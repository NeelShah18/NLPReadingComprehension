During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
Authors including William Whalen , Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses Barbara Grizzuti Harrison , Alan Rogerson and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religions by Jehovah ’ s Witnesses . Whalen , Harrison and Schnell have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society , and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God . Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed that Witnesses should " never seek a controversy " nor resist arrest , but also advised members not to co-operate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching , and to prefer jail rather than pay fines .
The Monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy , covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae . This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King William II of Sicily . The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina . The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor . Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos .
In 2010 Piraeus handled 513,319 TEUs , followed by Thessaloniki , which handled 273,282 TEUs . In the same year , 83.9 million people passed through Greece 's ports , 12.7 million through the port of Paloukia in Salamis , another 12.7 through the port of Perama , 9.5 million through Piraeus and 2.7 million through Igoumenitsa . In 2013 , Piraeus handled a record 3.16 million TEUs , the third-largest figure in the Mediterranean , of which 2.52 million were transported through Pier II , owned by COSCO and 644,000 were transported through Pier I , owned by the Greek state .
In the Graeco-Roman world , practitioners of magic were known as magi ( singular magus ) , a " foreign " title of Persian priests . Apuleius , defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells , defined the magician as " in popular tradition ( more vulgari ) ... someone who , because of his community of speech with the immortal gods , has an incredible power of spells ( vi cantaminum ) for everything he wishes to . " Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical " History of magical arts " from their supposed Persian origins to Nero 's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods . Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus , " despite his special knowledge of the future , his miraculous cures , and his ability to vanish into thin air " .
The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery , located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds , hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors , and regularly organizes exhibitions . It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art . Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery , located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house , giving an important insight into Nepali history . The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu , near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg , Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent , established Nepali painters . The Nepal Art Council Gallery , located in the Babar Mahal , on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions .
On May 1 , 1960 , a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over Soviet Union airspace . The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an East–West summit conference , which had been scheduled in Paris , 15 days later . Captain Francis Gary Powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil . Four days after Powers disappeared , the Eisenhower Administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had " gone missing " north of Turkey . It speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged , and falsely claimed that " the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties . "
Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized , the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation . On the contrary , the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation . The Magisterial reformers , such as Martin Luther , John Calvin , and Huldrych Zwingli , believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church , which they viewed as having become corrupted . Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation , denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them . In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church , Protestants often posited a new argument , saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority , only a spiritual , invisible , and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation .
In terms of ship categories , Greek companies have 22.6 % of the world 's tankers and 16.1 % of the world 's bulk carriers ( in dwt ) . An additional equivalent of 27.45 % of the world 's tanker dwt is on order , with another 12.7 % of bulk carriers also on order . Shipping accounts for an estimated 6 % of Greek GDP , employs about 160,000 people ( 4 % of the workforce ) , and represents 1/3 of the country 's trade deficit . Earnings from shipping amounted to €14.1 billion in 2011 , while between 2000 and 2010 Greek shipping contributed a total of €140 billion ( half of the country 's public debt in 2009 and 3.5 times the receipts from the European Union in the period 2000–2013 ) . The 2011 ECSA report showed that there are approximately 750 Greek shipping companies in operation .
The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples ( such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription ) was established in the late 6th century BC under the Orontid dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire as part of the latters ' territories , and which later became a kingdom . At its zenith ( 95–65 BC ) , the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey , Lebanon , and northern Iran . The imperial reign of Tigranes the Great is thus the span of time during which Armenia itself conquered areas populated by other peoples .
Raymond B. Bragg , the associate editor of The New Humanist , sought to consolidate the input of Leon Milton Birkhead , Charles Francis Potter , and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference . Bragg asked Roy Wood Sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 . Potter 's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism , the latter declaring a new religion by saying , " any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age . To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present . " It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion .
Although each institution is organized differently , nearly all universities have a board of trustees ; a president , chancellor , or rector ; at least one vice president , vice-chancellor , or vice-rector ; and deans of various divisions . Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments , schools or faculties . Public university systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system . They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs . In addition , they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country . However , many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial , research and pedagogical autonomy . Private universities are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies . However , they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances .
Besides being the political center , Brasília is an important economic center . Brasília has the highest city gross domestic product ( GDP ) of 99.5 billion reais representing 3.76 % of the total Brazilian GDP . The main economic activity of the federal capital results from its administrative function . Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District . Being a city registered by UNESCO , the government in Brasília has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software , film , video , and gemology among others , with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance , preserving the city property .
Colquhoun 's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives . Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street , the river police were full-time , salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees . His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing ; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames . Colquhoun 's innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel 's " new " police three decades later .
The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia . The medals were struck from September 1958 through October 1960 . A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858 . Each of the designs incorporates the text " with appreciation " or " with personal and official gratitude " accompanied with Eisenhower 's initials " D.D.E . " or facsimile signature . The design also incorporates location , date , and/or significant event . Prior to the end of his second term as President , 1,451 medals were turned-in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed . The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances . The purposes of obstruction are several , such as frustrating the majority party 's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party . " We know how to delay , " remarked Minority Leader Gephardt Dilatory motions to adjourn , appeals of the presiding officer 's ruling , or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics . By stalling action on the majority party 's agenda , the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a " do-nothing Congress " and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House . To be sure , the minority leader recognizes that " going negative " carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public .
The Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century . One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the Eucharist . Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic dogma of transubstantiation , which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body , blood , soul , and divinity of Christ . They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion .
Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx ; in addition , a La Quinta Inn that has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront . The Kingsbridge Armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center . Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway 's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College . The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost US $ 350–500 million .
In 1870 , Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to study the Bible . During the course of his ministry , Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul , hellfire , predestination , the fleshly return of Jesus Christ , the Trinity , and the burning up of the world . In 1876 , Russell met Nelson H. Barbour ; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds , which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy . The book taught that God 's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally , each ending with a " harvest , " that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the " harvest of the Gospel age , " and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called " the Gentile Times , " at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God 's kingdom on earth . Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal , Herald of the Morning . In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences , and in July , Russell began publishing the magazine Zion 's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ 's Presence , stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in " the last days , " and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
Colloquially , the term university may be used to describe a phase in one 's life : " When I was at university ... " ( in the United States and Ireland , college is often used instead : " When I was in college ... " ) . In Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , Nigeria , the Netherlands , Spain and the German-speaking countries university is often contracted to uni . In Ghana , New Zealand and in South Africa it is sometimes called " varsity " ( although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years ) . " Varsity " was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century . [ citation needed ] " Varsity " is still in common usage in Scotland .

For the popular taste however , light music , particularly Ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of Mehdi Hassan , Ghulam Ali , Nur Jehan , Malika Pukhraj , Farida Khanum , Roshen Ara Begum , and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan are well-known . Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . Luddi , Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living . Love legends of Heer Ranjha , Mirza Sahiban , Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
The Bronx Museum of the Arts , founded in 1971 , exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) of galleries . Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx . Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art , primarily by artists from Africa , Asia and Latin America , including paintings , photographs , prints , drawings , and mixed media . The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica .
An exceptionally well preserved , carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany , the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390 . Because of its purely geometrical pattern , the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas , especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem . A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor .
The structure of a mosque is simple and it expresses openness . Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab . The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam ( 1320 AD ) at Multan are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy . The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi ( 1150 AD ) at Multan . A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar , with its brilliant blue dome . The tile-work of Emperor Shah Jahan is of a richer and more elaborate nature . The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world .
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university . The University of Bologna adopted an academic charter , the Constitutio Habita , in 1158 or 1155 , which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education . Today this is claimed as the origin of " academic freedom " . This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988 , 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum , marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna 's foundation . The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow , drawing from all parts of the world .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God 's kingdom in October 1914 , and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . They believe that Jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word parousia—usually translated as " coming " when referring to Christ—as " presence " . They believe Jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the " second coming " of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
The Bronx is the home of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball . The original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue , a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships . With the famous facade , the short right field porch and Monument Park , Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball 's greatest players including Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Whitey Ford , Yogi Berra , Mickey Mantle , Reggie Jackson , Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera .
Wherever the Magisterial Reformation , which received support from the ruling authorities , took place , the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church , but disagreeing , in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice , with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters , namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church . The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity , founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement , rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils , but rejecting the latest ecumenical council , the Council of Trent . Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character , wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ , not common identity , doctrine , belief , and collaborative action .
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . Many wars , and especially the Thirty Years ' War , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times . War , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . Internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . As universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the University of Paris ) became more and more prominent . Although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . Control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel . After a few months with no success by the French , he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes . Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval . When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954 , Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the Vice President and the head of NCS .
The total length of roads in Nepal is recorded to be ( 17,182 km ( 10,676 mi ) ) , as of 2003–04 . This fairly large network has helped the economic development of the country , particularly in the fields of agriculture , horticulture , vegetable farming , industry and also tourism . In view of the hilly terrain , transportation takes place in Kathmandu are mainly by road and air . Kathmandu is connected by the Tribhuvan Highway to the south , Prithvi Highway to the west and Araniko Highway to the north . The BP Highway , connecting Kathmandu to the eastern part of Nepal is under construction .
Furthermore , evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores . North American megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event , possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought . However , in other locations such as Australia , humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to human occupation .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are organized hierarchically , in what the leadership calls a " theocratic organization " , reflecting their belief that it is God 's " visible organization " on earth . The organization is led by the Governing Body—an all-male group that varies in size , but since early 2014 has comprised seven members , [ note 1 ] all of whom profess to be of the " anointed " class with a hope of heavenly life—based in the Watch Tower Society 's Brooklyn headquarters . There is no election for membership ; new members are selected by the existing body . Until late 2012 , the Governing Body described itself as the representative and " spokesman " for God 's " faithful and discreet slave class " ( approximately 10,000 self-professed " anointed " Jehovah 's Witnesses ) . At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society , the " faithful and discreet slave " was defined as referring to the Governing Body only . The Governing Body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions , including publishing , assembly programs and evangelizing activities . It appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers , after they have been recommended by local branches , with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions . Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants , and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief .
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity .
Since then , the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party 's nominee for President , starting with a vote of 2-1 for the unsuccessful Al Smith in 1928 , followed by four 2-1 votes for the successful Franklin D. Roosevelt . ( Both had been Governors of New York , but Republican former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey won only 28 % of the Bronx 's vote in 1948 against 55 % for Pres . Harry Truman , the winning Democrat , and 17 % for Henry A. Wallace of the Progressives . It was only 32 years earlier , by contrast , that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency , Charles Evans Hughes , had won 42.6 % of the Bronx 's 1916 vote against Democratic President Woodrow Wilson 's 49.8 % and Socialist candidate Allan Benson 's 7.3 % . )
The spread of Greek literature , mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome 's festivals and rituals , and the embellishment of its mythology . Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus , who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals . In the last century of the Republic , Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite , most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods ; notably , Scaevola and the polymath Varro . For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus ' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction ; what the people believed was not itself the truth , but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with . Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives , the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals , and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult .
As the election approached , other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president . In January 1948 , after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention , Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was " not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office " ; " life-long professional soldiers " , he wrote , " in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason , [ should ] abstain from seeking high political office " . Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time . Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president ; Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the other probable winner , would presumably serve two terms , and Eisenhower , at age 66 in 1956 , would then be too old .
A sociological comparative study by the Pew Research Center found that Jehovah 's Witnesses in the United States ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation , belief in God , importance of religion in one 's life , frequency of religious attendance , frequency of prayers , frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services , belief their prayers are answered , belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way , belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life , opposition to abortion , and opposition to homosexuality . In the study , Jehovah 's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics .
A national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state . Some national universities are closely associated with national cultural or political aspirations , for instance the National University of Ireland in the early days of Irish independence collected a large amount of information on the Irish language and Irish culture . Reforms in Argentina were the result of the University Revolution of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system .
During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent , the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula . India continued to collide with Asia . The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene .
The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The large villa rustica , which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century . The most important pieces are the Circus Scene , the 64m long Great Hunting Scene , the Little Hunt , the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis . The peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered . The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus , Alexander the Great 's Hunt and the Four Seasons .
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie , who had 44 commissaires de police ( police commissioners ) under his authority . In 1709 , these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police ( police inspectors ) . The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires , each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy . The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699 , resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns .
The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia , itself a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia , was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion ( it had formerly been adherent to Armenian paganism , which was influenced by Zoroastrianism , while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with Greco-Roman deities ) . in the early years of the 4th century , likely AD 301 , partly in defiance of the Sassanids it seems . In the late Parthian period , Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land , but by the Christianisation , previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined . Later on , in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity , Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet , in 405 AD . This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia , during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop 's pupils . Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires , until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived .
Prodigies were transgressions in the natural , predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune . The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false , or genuine and in the public interest , in which case it was referred to the public priests , augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation . In 207 BC , during one of the Punic Wars ' worst crises , the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved " at least twenty days " of dedicated rites .
The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge , also known as the 'President JK Bridge ' or the 'JK Bridge ' , crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasília . It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira , former president of Brazil . It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde . Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to " ... outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment , aesthetic merit and successful community participation " .
In the original city plan , the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station . Because of the growth of Brasília ( and corresponding growth in the bus fleet ) , today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station ( called Rodoferroviária ) , located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental . The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station . A new bus station was opened in July 2010 . It is on Saída Sul ( South Exit ) near Parkshopping Mall and with its metro station , and it 's also an inter-state bus station , used only to leave the Federal District .
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole . An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct . Jainism is practiced by a small community . A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar , where Jains practice their faith . According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal , there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley . They have a National Office located in Shantinagar , Baneshwor . The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu . Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of Nepal . [ citation needed ] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches . Christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies , who had converted to Christianity while in service , on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion . They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu , in particular .
Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by " prefects " for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin , dozens of prefects were spread across the state , each having limited authority and employment period . They were appointed by local magistrates , who reported to higher authorities such as governors , who in turn were appointed by the emperor , and they oversaw the civil administration of their " prefecture " , or jurisdiction . Under each prefect were " subprefects " who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area . Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations , much like modern police detectives . Prefects could also be women . The concept of the " prefecture system " spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan .
During the later part of the Malla era , Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities : Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , and Kirtipur . These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal . These states competed with each other in the arts , architecture , aesthetics , and trade , resulting in tremendous development . The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings , squares , and temples , as well as the development of water spouts , the institutionalization of trusts ( called guthis ) , the codification of laws , the writing of dramas , and the performance of plays in city squares . Evidence of an influx of ideas from India , Tibet , China , Persia , and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla . Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition ( e.g . Tantrakhyan ) , medicine ( e.g . Haramekhala ) , religion ( e.g . Mooldevshashidev ) , law , morals , and history . Amarkosh , a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD , was also found . Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square , Patan Durbar Square , Bhaktapur Durbar Square , the former durbar of Kirtipur , Nyatapola , Kumbheshwar , the Krishna temple , and others .
Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with the Senate Majority Leader , the House Majority Leader 's duties and prominence vary depending upon the style and power of the Speaker of the House . Typically , the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor . In some cases , Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker ; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert . In addition , Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor .
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
They formed , and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and group piety . Puritans adopted a Reformed theology , but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva . In church polity , some advocated for separation from all other Christians , in favor of autonomous gathered churches . These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church .
The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . In times of great crisis , the Senate could decree collective public rites , in which Rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
^Note 2 : in 1789 the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows : " Article IV . Section 10 . No person within this state shall , upon any pretense , be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience , nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment ; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes , taxes , or any other rate , for the building or repairing any place of worship , or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry , contrary to what he believes to be right , or hath voluntarily engaged to do . No one religious society shall ever be established in this state , in preference to another ; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles . "
The impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of Rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion . In this spirit , a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . What in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in Britain . Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . Pairs of Sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
Juscelino Kubitschek , President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961 , ordered the construction of Brasília , fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise . Building Brasília was part of Juscelino 's " fifty years of prosperity in five " plan . Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957 , with 5550 people competing . Oscar Niemeyer , a close friend , was the chief architect of most public buildings and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer . Brasília was built in 41 months , from 1956 to April 21 , 1960 , when it was officially inaugurated .
In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the Spirit . Generally , however , Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as Word of Faith , Toronto Blessing , Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival . Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the USA , in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is Terry Virgo .
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . The most important is the so-called " Armenian Mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate . It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . Populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . The inscription reads : " For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows . " Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
Brasília ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ bɾaˈziljɐ ] ) is the federal capital of Brazil and seat of government of the Federal District . The city is located atop the Brazilian highlands in the country 's center-western region . It was founded on April 21 , 1960 , to serve as the new national capital . Brasília and its metro ( encompassing the whole of the Federal District ) had a population of 2,556,149 in 2011 , making it the 4th most populous city in Brazil . Among major Latin American cities , Brasília has the highest GDP per capita at R $ 61,915 ( US $ 36,175 ) .
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective . Pliny the Elder declared that " a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods . " Prayer by itself , however , had independent power . The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action , and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy . Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked , hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities . Public prayers ( prex ) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community . Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly ; a mistake might require that the action , or even the entire festival , be repeated from the start . The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the " Roman people " among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer ; the festival had to be started over . Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic , a recitation rather than a personal expression , though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion .
Swayambhu is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city . This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal . Although the site is considered Buddhist , it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus . The stupa consists of a dome at the base ; above the dome , there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions . [ clarification needed ] There are pentagonal Toran above each of the four sides , with statues engraved on them . Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers . Above all the tiers , there is a small space above which lies a gajur .
The heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century . The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule . Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style , that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies . Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II , the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale .
Eisenhower 's stint as the president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within the Council on Foreign Relations , a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the Marshall Plan , and The American Assembly , Eisenhower 's " vision of a great cultural center where business , professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature " . His biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook suggested that this period served as " the political education of General Eisenhower " , since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational , administrative , and financial demands for the university . Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations , he also gained exposure to economic analysis , which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy . " Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics , he has learned at the study group meetings , " one Aid to Europe member claimed .
Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning , Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations . After selecting his budget director , Joseph M. Dodge , Eisenhower asked Herbert Brownell and Lucius Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments . He accepted their recommendations without exception ; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships , and one woman , Oveta Culp Hobby . Eisenhower 's cabinet , consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader , was dubbed by one journalist , " Eight millionaires and a plumber . " The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends , office seekers , or experienced government administrators . He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War .
The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU . Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor . Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013 , the third in Bulgaria , in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in former Yugoslavia and in other Balkan countries .
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate . Once in office , when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary , he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded . His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese . The National Security Council , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China . With the death of Stalin in early March 1953 , Russian support for a Chinese hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue .
Today , this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader . Less commonly , it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself . The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways . Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism , though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole . Broadly speaking , Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life . This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity .

Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied , and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy . The traditional care of the dead , however , and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion . Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased , an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods . As Roman society developed , its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead , and more on monumental endowments to the community , such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name . Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial , with such grave goods as relatives could afford .
The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages . In 1873 , the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge , West Farms and Morrisania to New York , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . In 1895 , three years before New York 's consolidation with Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island , the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River , including the Town of Westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham , were annexed to the city . City Island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .
Greece has tended to lag behind its European Union partners in terms of Internet use , with the gap closing rapidly in recent years . The percentage of households with access to the Internet more than doubled between 2006 and 2013 , from 23 % to 56 % respectively ( compared with an EU average of 49 % and 79 % ) . At the same time , there has been a massive increase in the proportion of households with a broadband connection , from 4 % in 2006 to 55 % in 2013 ( compared with an EU average of 30 % and 76 % ) . However , Greece also has the EU 's third highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet : 36 % in 2013 , down from 65 % in 2006 ( compared with an EU average of 21 % and 42 % ) .

Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
The first centrally organised police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris , then the largest city in Europe . The royal edict , registered by the Parlement of Paris on March 15 , 1667 created the office of lieutenant général de police ( " lieutenant general of police " ) , who was to be the head of the new Paris police force , and defined the task of the police as " ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals , purging the city of what may cause disturbances , procuring abundance , and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties " .

Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies . Eventually , the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere . The Moon formed soon afterwards , possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10 % of the Earth 's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow . Some of this object 's mass merged with the Earth , significantly altering its internal composition , and a portion was ejected into space . Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon . Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere . Condensing water vapor , augmented by ice delivered from comets , produced the oceans .
Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the Great Palace of Constantinople which was commissioned during Justinian 's reign . The figures , animals , plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background . The portrait of a moustached man , probably a Gothic chieftain , is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age . The so-called small sekreton of the palace was built during Justin II 's reign around 565–577 . Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room . The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition . There are remains of floral decoration in the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki ( 5th–6th centuries ) .
During this early period , it was more usual that neither major party grouping ( Federalists and Democratic-Republicans ) had an official leader . In 1813 , for instance , a scholar recounts that the Federalist minority of 36 Members needed a committee of 13 " to represent a party comprising a distinct minority " and " to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause . " In 1828 , a foreign observer of the House offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership on Capitol Hill :
In the Graeco-Roman world , practitioners of magic were known as magi ( singular magus ) , a " foreign " title of Persian priests . Apuleius , defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells , defined the magician as " in popular tradition ( more vulgari ) ... someone who , because of his community of speech with the immortal gods , has an incredible power of spells ( vi cantaminum ) for everything he wishes to . " Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical " History of magical arts " from their supposed Persian origins to Nero 's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods . Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus , " despite his special knowledge of the future , his miraculous cures , and his ability to vanish into thin air " .
Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War , Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ver sacrum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies . The " contract " with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed . All due care would be taken of the animals . If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . Normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be withheld . In the imperial period , sacrifice was withheld following Trajan 's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period . In Pompeii , the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries , including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal . Nepal 's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions , Hinduism and Buddhhism . These are amply reflected in the many temples , shrines , stupas , monasteries , and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site . This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur . The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day , including archeological exportation .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain . The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character . They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen , supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople , who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain . The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy . The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus , which was lost for the Umayyad family .

Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
In November 2008 , 720p HD support was added . At the time of the 720p launch , the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9 . With this new feature , YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format . In November 2009 , 1080p HD support was added . In July 2010 , YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format , which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels . In June 2015 , support for 8K resolution was added , with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the pax deorum with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was ( in traditional Roman terms ) auspicious - or in Christian terms , what was orthodox . The edict of Milan ( 313 ) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration . Constantine had triumphed under the signum ( sign ) of the Christ : Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital , Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests . He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian 's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch . His later direct intervention in Church affairs proved a political masterstroke . Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state , and on his death , he was honored as a Christian , Imperial , and " divus " .
The National Library of Nepal is located in Patan . It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books . English , Nepali , Sanskrit , Hindi , and Nepal Bhasa books are found here . The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD . Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library , located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building . This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana . It covers a wide range of subjects including history , law , art , religion , and philosophy , as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra , which is believed to be over 1,000 years old . The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building , and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated .
Exhibitions and annual horse shows in all districts and a national horse and cattle show at Lahore are held with the official patronage . The national horse and cattle show at Lahore is the biggest festival where sports , exhibitions , and livestock competitions are held . It not only encourages and patronises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots .
Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant . Since 1900 , Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa , Asia , Oceania and Latin America . That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion . Much of the growth has occurred after World War II , when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred . According to one source , Protestants constituted respectively 2.5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % of Latin Americans , Africans and Asians . In 2000 , percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17 % , more than 27 % and 5.5 % , respectively . According to Mark A. Noll , 79 % of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910 , while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth . By 2010 , 59 % of Anglicans were found in Africa . In 2010 , more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany , while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined . Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe . China is home to world 's largest Protestant minority . [ af ]
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
Peel , widely regarded as the father of modern policing , was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham , who called for a strong and centralized , but politically neutral , police force for the maintenance of social order , for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder . Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession , to organise it in a civilian fashion , and to make it answerable to the public .
IMF 's forecast said that Greece 's unemployment rate would hit the highest 14.8 percent in 2012 and decrease to 14.1 in 2014 . But in fact , the Greek economy suffered a prolonged high unemployemnt . The unemployment figure was between 9 per cent and 11 per cent in 2009 , and it soared to 28 per cent in 2013 . In 2015 , Greece 's jobless rate is around 24 per cent . It is thought that Greece 's potential output has been eroded by this prolonged massive unemployment due to the associated hysteresis effects .
At the 2009 American Community Survey , Black Americans made the second largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos . Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third ( 35.4 % ) of the Bronx 's population . Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 30.8 % of the population . Over 495,200 blacks resided in the borough , of which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks . Over 61,000 people identified themselves as " Sub-Saharan African " in the survey , making up 4.4 % of the population .
In 1758 , the general of the Hindu Maratha Empire , Raghunath Rao conquered Lahore and Attock . Timur Shah Durrani , the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali , was driven out of Punjab . Lahore , Multan , Dera Ghazi Khan , Kashmir and other subahs on the south and eastern side of Peshawar were under the Maratha rule for the most part . In Punjab and Kashmir , the Marathas were now major players . The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 1761 , Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded the Maratha territory of Punjab and captured remnants of the Maratha Empire in Punjab and Kashmir regions and re-consolidated control over them .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
After golf , oil painting was Eisenhower 's second hobby . While at Columbia University , Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie 's portrait . Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax , mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie , their grandchildren , General Montgomery , George Washington , and Abraham Lincoln . Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower 's work , " simple and earnest , rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president " . A conservative in both art and politics , he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as " a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie , loaded with paint , has been driven over it . "
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy ( the Latin kings of Alba Longa ) with the well-known legend of Rome 's founding by Romulus and Remus . The most common version of the twins ' story displays several aspects of hero myth . Their mother , Rhea Silvia , had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin , in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father . Through divine intervention , the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars . She gave birth to twins , who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events .
Promote and Publicize the Party 's Agenda . An important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independents and swing voters . Despite the minority leader 's restricted ability to set the House 's agenda , there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities . For example , the minority leader may employ , or threaten to use , discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor . If he or she is able to attract the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting majority party supporters , he or she can force minority initiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership . As a GOP minority leader once said , the challenges he confronted are to " keep our people together , and to look for votes on the other side . "
The Bronx is almost entirely situated on the North American mainland . The Hudson River separates the Bronx on the west from Alpine , Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County , New Jersey ; the Harlem River separates it from the island of Manhattan to the southwest ; the East River separates it from Queens to the southeast ; and to the east , Long Island Sound separates it from Nassau County in western Long Island . Directly north of the Bronx are ( from west to east ) the adjoining Westchester County communities of Yonkers , Mount Vernon , Pelham Manor and New Rochelle . ( There is also a short southern land boundary with Marble Hill in the Borough of Manhattan , over the filled-in former course of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek . Marble Hill 's postal ZIP code , telephonic Area Code and fire service , however , are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan . )
The peninsular borough 's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system 's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. B. J. Snyder . The state 's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler ( on the southeastern shore ) houses the Maritime Industry Museum . In addition , the Harlem River is reemerging as " Scullers ' Row " due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project , a joint public-private endeavor of the city 's parks department . Canoeing and kayaking on the borough 's namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance . The river is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens , its neighbor , the Bronx Zoo , and a little further south , on the west shore , Bronx River Art Center .
The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples ( such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription ) was established in the late 6th century BC under the Orontid dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire as part of the latters ' territories , and which later became a kingdom . At its zenith ( 95–65 BC ) , the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey , Lebanon , and northern Iran . The imperial reign of Tigranes the Great is thus the span of time during which Armenia itself conquered areas populated by other peoples .
Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy . Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely , at some point , on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent . Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments , such as the compound light microscope , or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope . Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope , and can often rapidly lead to identification . Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques , and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques . For example , the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent ( fluorescently labeled antibodies ) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen . A fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells . This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases , where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly .
In 1899 , the memorial , by the Berlin sculptor Ernst Gustav Herter ( 1846–1917 ) , finally came to rest , although subject to repeated vandalism , in the Bronx , at 164th Street and the Grand Concourse , or Joyce Kilmer Park near today 's Yankee Stadium . ( In 1999 , it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse . ) In 2007 , Christopher Gray of The New York Times described it as " a writhing composition in white Tyrolean marble depicting Lorelei , the mythical German figure , surrounded by mermaids , dolphins and seashells . "
During this early period , it was more usual that neither major party grouping ( Federalists and Democratic-Republicans ) had an official leader . In 1813 , for instance , a scholar recounts that the Federalist minority of 36 Members needed a committee of 13 " to represent a party comprising a distinct minority " and " to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause . " In 1828 , a foreign observer of the House offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership on Capitol Hill :
Among the Punjabi poets , the names of Sultan Bahu , Bulleh Shah , Mian Muhammad Baksh , and Waris Shah and folk singers like Inayat Hussain Bhatti and Tufail Niazi , Alam Lohar , Sain Marna , Mansoor Malangi , Allah Ditta Lona wala , Talib Hussain Dard , Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi , Gamoo Tahliwala , Mamzoo Gha-lla , Akbar Jat , Arif Lohar , Ahmad Nawaz Cheena and Hamid Ali Bela are well-known . In the composition of classical ragas , there are such masters as Malika-i-Mauseequi ( Queen of Music ) Roshan Ara Begum , Ustad Amanat Ali Khan , Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Fateh Ali Khan . Alam Lohar has made significant contributions to folklore and Punjabi literature , by being a very influential Punjabi folk singer from 1930 until 1979 .
Sociologist James A. Beckford , in his 1975 study of Jehovah 's Witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as Totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . Beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that Jehovah 's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the landmark case of Everson v. Board of Education has impacted the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments . Although upholding the state law in that case , which provided for public busing to private religious schools , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments . A more recent case involving the application of this principle against the states was Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) .
Beginning in first decade of the 15th century , Jan Hus—a Roman Catholic priest , Czech reformist and professor—influenced by John Wycliffe 's writings , founded the Hussite movement . He strongly advocated his reformist Bohemian religious denomination . He was excommunicated and burned at the stake in Constance , Bishopric of Constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy . After his execution , a revolt erupted . Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the Pope .
Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith ( see Christian Humanism ) . They inveighed against the abuses of the Church , but not against the Church itself , much less against religion . For them , the word " secular " carried no connotations of disbelief – that would come later , in the nineteenth century . In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery . Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo 's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own ( although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life ) . He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue , inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer . By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base , however , the methods of the humanists , combined with their eloquence , would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority .
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . Many wars , and especially the Thirty Years ' War , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times . War , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . Internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . As universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the University of Paris ) became more and more prominent . Although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . Control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
Minority leaders may engage in numerous activities to publicize their party 's priorities and to criticize the opposition 's . For instance , to keep their party colleagues " on message , " they insure that partisan colleagues are sent packets of suggested press releases or " talking points " for constituent meetings in their districts ; they help to organize " town meetings " in Members ' districts around the country to publicize the party 's agenda or a specific priority , such as health care or education ; they sponsor party " retreats " to discuss issues and assess the party 's public image ; they create " theme teams " to craft party messages that might be raised during the one-minute , morning hour , or special order period in the House ; they conduct surveys of party colleagues to discern their policy preferences ; they establish websites that highlight and distribute party images and issues to users ; and they organize task forces or issue teams to formulate party programs and to develop strategies for communicating these programs to the public .
An exceptionally well preserved , carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany , the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390 . Because of its purely geometrical pattern , the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas , especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem . A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor .
The 1829 Metropolitan Police Act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers , and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system . Their job was apolitical ; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law . This was very different to the 'Continental model ' of the police force that had been developed in France , where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state .
In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war . Believing that a general should not participate in politics , one author later wrote that " figuratively speaking , [ Eisenhower ] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office " . As others asked him about his political future , Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job " from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe " , and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions . In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired , the president would help the general win the 1948 election , and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower 's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination .
Just as artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci – partaking of the zeitgeist though not himself a humanist – advocated study of human anatomy , nature , and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art , so Spanish-born humanist Juan Luis Vives ( c. 1493–1540 ) advocated observation , craft , and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities , helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism . Thus , the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to natural philosophy , based on empirical observations and experimentation of the physical universe , making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance .
The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time , as individual scientists , associations and universities were vying for limited resources . There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public , or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities . Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors , and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions , they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors .
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma . During the Silurian , Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes , but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation . The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels , recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments , forming an unconformity . Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator , starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica . The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere . Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys , Paleo-Tethys , Rheic Ocean , a seaway of Iapetus Ocean ( now in between Avalonia and Laurentia ) , and newly formed Ural Ocean .
The major and native language spoken in the Punjab is Punjabi ( which is written in a Shahmukhi script in Pakistan ) and Punjabis comprise the largest ethnic group in country . Punjabi is the provincial language of Punjab . There is not a single district in the province where Punjabi language is mother-tongue of less than 89 % of population . The language is not given any official recognition in the Constitution of Pakistan at the national level . Punjabis themselves are a heterogeneous group comprising different tribes , clans ( Urdu : برادری‎ ) and communities . In Pakistani Punjab these tribes have more to do with traditional occupations such as blacksmiths or artisans as opposed to rigid social stratifications . Punjabi dialects spoken in the province include Majhi ( Standard ) , Saraiki and Hindko . Saraiki is mostly spoken in south Punjab , and Pashto , spoken in some parts of north west Punjab , especially in Attock District and Mianwali District .
The major roles of construction and of services ( government , communications , banking and finance , food production , entertainment , and legal services ) in Brasília 's economy reflect the city 's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center . Industries connected with construction , food processing , and furnishings are important , as are those associated with publishing , printing , and computer software . GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8 % , Services 28.7 % , Industry 10.2 % , Commerce 6.1 % , Agribusiness 0.2 % .

In addition to the above , Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea , as well as the Libyan Sea , within the Greek exclusive economic zone , south of Crete . The Ministry of the Environment , Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including Norway and the United States ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012 . In November 2012 , a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion .
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when Rome developed its own distinctive artistic style , free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space . Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente , the façade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura . The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere ( 1140 ) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne , the first example of this iconographic scheme . A similar mosaic , the Coronation of the Virgin , decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore . It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295 . The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884 . The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini , the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century . Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290 . These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective . There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave . The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves .
Eliot and her circle , who included her companion George Henry Lewes ( the biographer of Goethe ) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau , were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte , whom Martineau had translated . Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity ( which worshiped the dead , since most humans who have ever lived are dead ) , complete with holidays and liturgy , modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism . Although Comte 's English followers , like Eliot and Martineau , for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system , they liked the idea of a religion of humanity . Comte 's austere vision of the universe , his injunction to " vivre pour altrui " ( " live for others " , from which comes the word " altruism " ) , and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy .
Much of YouTube 's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos . In 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders . YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue . In May 2013 , Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games . In February 2015 , Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators .
Haruspicy was also used in public cult , under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate . The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice , particularly the liver . They also interpreted omens , prodigies and portents , and formulated their expiation . Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient , ethnically Etruscan " outsider " religious profession , separate from Rome 's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy , essential but never quite respectable . During the mid-to-late Republic , the reformist Gaius Gracchus , the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla , and the " notorious Verres " justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners . The senate and armies used the public haruspices : at some time during the late Republic , the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination . Being of independent means , they would be better motivated to maintain a pure , religious practice for the public good . The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect : none of this seems to have troubled Marius , who employed a Syrian prophetess .
Edwin Chadwick 's 1829 article , " Preventive police " in the London Review , argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body , which was not the case in practice . The reason , argued Chadwick , was that " A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation . " In contrast to a deterrent of punishment , a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - " crime does n't pay " . In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act , the " object " of the new Metropolitan Police , was changed by Robert Peel to the " principal object , " which was the " prevention of crime . " Later historians would attribute the perception of England 's " appearance of orderliness and love of public order " to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel 's police system .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
In 1870 , Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to study the Bible . During the course of his ministry , Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul , hellfire , predestination , the fleshly return of Jesus Christ , the Trinity , and the burning up of the world . In 1876 , Russell met Nelson H. Barbour ; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds , which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy . The book taught that God 's dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally , each ending with a " harvest , " that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the " harvest of the Gospel age , " and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called " the Gentile Times , " at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God 's kingdom on earth . Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal , Herald of the Morning . In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences , and in July , Russell began publishing the magazine Zion 's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ 's Presence , stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in " the last days , " and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent .
The Interstate Highway System is officially known as the 'Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways ' in his honor . It was inspired in part by Eisenhower 's own Army experiences in World War II , where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . Commemorative signs reading " Eisenhower Interstate System " and bearing Eisenhower 's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System . Several highways are also named for him , including the Eisenhower Expressway ( Interstate 290 ) near Chicago and the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver .
Critics of the modern concept of the " separation of church and state " argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it . Philip Hamburger , Columbia Law school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept , maintains that the modern concept , which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence , is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and Nativism . [ citation needed ] Briefs before the Supreme Court , including by the U.S. government , have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state ( Blaine Amendments ) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism .
The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977–1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992–2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " .
Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the pax deorum with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was ( in traditional Roman terms ) auspicious - or in Christian terms , what was orthodox . The edict of Milan ( 313 ) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration . Constantine had triumphed under the signum ( sign ) of the Christ : Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital , Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests . He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian 's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch . His later direct intervention in Church affairs proved a political masterstroke . Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state , and on his death , he was honored as a Christian , Imperial , and " divus " .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as " the truth " and consider themselves to be " in the truth " . They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses . Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned . Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
Very few historical records exist of the period before the medieval Licchavis rulers . According to Gopalraj Vansawali , a genealogy of Nepali monarchs , the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas , Mahispalas , Aabhirs , Kirants , and Somavanshi . The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber . During the Kirata era , a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu . In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages , Kathmandu is still called Yambu . Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu , near Manjupattan . During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler , Jitedasti , Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at Sankhu .
The Third Great Awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . It was affiliated with the Social Gospel Movement , which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . New groupings emerged , such as the Holiness , Nazarene , and Christian Science movements .
Starting in the 1970s , the Bronx often symbolized violence , decay , and urban ruin . The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that " The Bronx is burning " : in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film . The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series , when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los Angeles Dodgers . Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire . As the fire was captured on live television , announcer Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like , " There it is , ladies and gentlemen : the Bronx is burning " . Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell 's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough 's decline . A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning is in production in 2006 , chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough .
Politically , Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . He appreciated the advantages of democracy : " It is an invaluable gift , if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God . To further protect the rights of ordinary people , Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . Besides England , the Netherlands were , under Calvinist leadership , the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle . Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible .
In November 1945 , Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army . His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers , a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping . Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained ; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs . However , in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets , Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon . Indeed , Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese , writing , " First , the Japanese were ready to surrender and it was n't necessary to hit them with that awful thing . Second , I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon . " Initially , Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets . He even visited Warsaw in 1945 . Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration , he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city . However , by mid-1947 , as East–West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated , Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion .
Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in December 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis , Washington . In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce . In June 1941 , he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger , Commander of the 3rd Army , at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas . After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers , he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3 , 1941 . Although his administrative abilities had been noticed , on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations .
Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by " prefects " for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin , dozens of prefects were spread across the state , each having limited authority and employment period . They were appointed by local magistrates , who reported to higher authorities such as governors , who in turn were appointed by the emperor , and they oversaw the civil administration of their " prefecture " , or jurisdiction . Under each prefect were " subprefects " who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area . Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations , much like modern police detectives . Prefects could also be women . The concept of the " prefecture system " spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan .
After the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa , Eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of Sicily . Once Mussolini , the Italian leader , had fallen in Italy , the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche . But while Eisenhower argued with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill , who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians , the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country – making the job more difficult , by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1 ; nevertheless , the invasion of Italy was highly successful .
Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century , and at age 62 , was the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856 ( President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier ) . Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency ( The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor , Ulysses S. Grant , William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover ) .
In 2002 , a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under God . " In reaction to the case , Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . Rather , a five-justice majority held that Newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored , a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists . The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture , introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo . The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks ( interpretatio graeca ) , adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art . Etruscan religion was also a major influence , particularly on the practice of augury .
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Several countries have established their national churches , linking the ecclesiastical structure with the state . Jurisdictions where a Protestant denomination has been established as a state religion include several Nordic countries ; Denmark ( including Greenland ) , the Faroe Islands ( its church being independent since 2007 ) , Iceland and Norway have established Evangelical Lutheran churches . Tuvalu has the only established church in Reformed tradition in the world , while Tonga—in the Methodist tradition . The Church of England is the officially established religious institution in England , and also the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion .
Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian . However , the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon , and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city . Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places . Buff ( meat of water buffalo ) is very common . There is a strong tradition of buff consumption in Kathmandu , especially among Newars , which is not found in other parts of Nepal . Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago . Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal , pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes . A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo . The Muslims forbid eating buff as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow 's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity . The chief breakfast for locals and visitors is mostly Momo or Chowmein .
In 1954 , Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America . He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India . Likewise , the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico . That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community ( EDC ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " Long faces do n't win wars " . As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC , he afterwards moved to restore West Germany , as a full NATO partner .
Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells ( defixiones ) , magical papyri and so-called " voodoo dolls " from a very early era . Around 250 defixiones have been recovered just from Roman Britain , in both urban and rural settings . Some seek straightforward , usually gruesome revenge , often for a lover 's offense or rejection . Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs , in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate , and promise a portion of the value ( usually small ) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration . None of these defixiones seem produced by , or on behalf of the elite , who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice . Similar traditions existed throughout the empire , persisting until around the 7th century AD , well into the Christian era .
Each camp had its own religious personnel ; standard bearers , priestly officers and their assistants , including a haruspex , and housekeepers of shrines and images . A senior magistrate-commander ( sometimes even a consul ) headed it , his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty . As in Rome , whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business ; legionary forts and vici included shrines to household gods , personal deities and deities otherwise unknown . From the earliest Imperial era , citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his familia on Imperial accessions , anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows . They celebrated Rome 's official festivals in absentia , and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire , Jupiter , Victoria and Concordia were typical . By the early Severan era , the military also offered cult to the Imperial divi , the current emperor 's numen , genius and domus ( or familia ) , and special cult to the Empress as " mother of the camp . " The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military concordia and Imperial loyalty .
When the U.S. entered World War I he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth , Kansas . In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers . His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps , where he was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel in the National Army . He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command – at the site of " Pickett 's Charge " on the Gettysburg , Pennsylvania Civil War battleground . Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat , he displayed excellent organizational skills , as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers ' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel .
From 1920 , Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals – Fox Conner , John J. Pershing , Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall . He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone , where , joined by Mamie , he served until 1924 . Under Conner 's tutelage , he studied military history and theory ( including Carl von Clausewitz 's On War ) , and later cited Conner 's enormous influence on his military thinking , saying in 1962 that " Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew . " Conner 's comment on Eisenhower was , " [ He ] is one of the most capable , efficient and loyal officers I have ever met . " On Conner 's recommendation , in 1925–26 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers . He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning , Georgia , until 1927 .
Today , Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism . With approximately 80 million adherents , it constitutes the third most common Protestant confession after historically Pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism . The Lutheran World Federation , the largest global communion of Lutheran churches represents over 72 million people . Additionally , there are also many smaller bodies such as the International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference , as well as independent churches .
Early in 1953 , the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists , supplied from China , who were fighting the First Indochina War . Eisenhower sent Lt. General John W. " Iron Mike " O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there . Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary . Eisenhower stated prophetically that " this war would absorb our troops by divisions . "

East of the Bronx River , the borough is relatively flat and includes four large low peninsulas , or 'necks , ' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh : Hunts Point , Clason 's Point , Screvin 's Neck ( Castle Hill Point ) and Throgs Neck . The East Bronx has older tenement buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multifamily homes , as well as single family homes . It includes New York City 's largest park : Pelham Bay Park along the Westchester-Bronx border .
French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign , and Eisenhower encountered a " preposterous situation " with the multiple rival factions in France . His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia , and intending to facilitate that objective , he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa , despite Darlan 's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces . The Allied leaders were " thunderstruck " by this from a political standpoint , though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation . Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move . Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle . Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies , considering it a criminal rather than a military matter . Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner , who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan 's commander-in-chief , and who had refused to postpone the execution .
From 1966 , Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Christ 's thousand-year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . The number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974 . By 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . Membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . Watch Tower Society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
With Eisenhower 's leadership and Dulles ' direction , CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries ; the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax , of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess , and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo ( Léopoldville ) . In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union . With Dulles ' recommendation , he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2 's at a cost of $ 35 million . The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba , which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out . "
In the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation , the Magisterial Reformation had not gone far enough . Radical Reformer , Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt , for example , referred to the Lutheran theologians at Wittenberg as the " new papists " . Since the term " magister " also means " teacher " , the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher . This is made evident in the prominence of Luther , Calvin , and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry . Because of their authority , they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes . A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of Hans Hut , although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere . After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526 , and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel , Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the " fallen city " of Geneva . His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life . After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559 , Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries . The faith continued to spread after Calvin 's death in 1563 .
Gephardt added that " inclusion and empowerment of the people on the line have to be done to get the best performance " from the minority party . Other techniques for fostering party harmony include the appointment of task forces composed of partisan colleagues with conflicting views to reach consensus on issues ; the creation of new leadership positions as a way to reach out and involve a greater diversity of partisans in the leadership structure ; and daily meetings in the Leader 's office ( or at breakfast , lunch , or dinner ) to lay out floor strategy or political objectives for the minority party .
A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious , miniature mosaic icons . In these icons the small tesserae ( with sides of 1 mm or less ) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel . These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion . The Louvre Transfiguration is a very fine example from the late 12th century . The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at Florence illustrates the more gentle , humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals .
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity .
The Latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself , but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury : " The architecture of the ancient Romans was , from first to last , an art of shaping space around ritual . " The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct , and the more common Latin words aedes , delubrum , or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building . The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture .
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective . Pliny the Elder declared that " a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods . " Prayer by itself , however , had independent power . The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action , and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy . Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked , hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities . Public prayers ( prex ) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community . Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly ; a mistake might require that the action , or even the entire festival , be repeated from the start . The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the " Roman people " among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer ; the festival had to be started over . Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic , a recitation rather than a personal expression , though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion .
In the Graeco-Roman world , practitioners of magic were known as magi ( singular magus ) , a " foreign " title of Persian priests . Apuleius , defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells , defined the magician as " in popular tradition ( more vulgari ) ... someone who , because of his community of speech with the immortal gods , has an incredible power of spells ( vi cantaminum ) for everything he wishes to . " Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical " History of magical arts " from their supposed Persian origins to Nero 's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods . Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus , " despite his special knowledge of the future , his miraculous cures , and his ability to vanish into thin air " .
Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society . In 1919 , he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation , and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters . At an international convention held at Cedar Point , Ohio , in September 1922 , a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching . Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford 's twenty-five years as president , including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs ( such as Abraham and Isaac ) would be resurrected in 1925 , marking the beginning of Christ 's thousand-year Kingdom . Disappointed by the changes , tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford 's tenure , leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society , most of which still exist . By mid-1919 , as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society , and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s .
Although each institution is organized differently , nearly all universities have a board of trustees ; a president , chancellor , or rector ; at least one vice president , vice-chancellor , or vice-rector ; and deans of various divisions . Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments , schools or faculties . Public university systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system . They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs . In addition , they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country . However , many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial , research and pedagogical autonomy . Private universities are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies . However , they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances .
The Bronx 's evolution from a hot bed of Latin jazz to an incubator of hip hop was the subject of an award-winning documentary , produced by City Lore and broadcast on PBS in 2006 , " From Mambo to Hip Hop : A South Bronx Tale " . Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s . The New York Times has identified 1520 Sedgwick Avenue " an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway and hard along the Major Deegan Expressway " as a starting point , where DJ Kool Herc presided over parties in the community room .
Conversely , YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens , the White House 's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson 's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) -compliant health insurance . In February 2014 , U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the " YouTube Generation " . Whereas YouTube 's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted , the YouTube content creators ' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website 's distracting content and fickle audience .
The monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors . The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85 . The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich . The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date ( discovered in 1930 ) . They were laid down in the Umayyad era , after a devastating earthquake in 659 . Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features .
The Interstate Highway System is officially known as the 'Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways ' in his honor . It was inspired in part by Eisenhower 's own Army experiences in World War II , where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . Commemorative signs reading " Eisenhower Interstate System " and bearing Eisenhower 's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System . Several highways are also named for him , including the Eisenhower Expressway ( Interstate 290 ) near Chicago and the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver .
Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166 , with mosaics tied into a tree of life , mostly still preserved . The scenes depict biblical characters , warrior kings , medieval beasts , allegories of the months and working activity . Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi 's Norman Cathedral . The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries .
The structure of a mosque is simple and it expresses openness . Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab . The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam ( 1320 AD ) at Multan are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy . The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi ( 1150 AD ) at Multan . A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar , with its brilliant blue dome . The tile-work of Emperor Shah Jahan is of a richer and more elaborate nature . The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired , inerrant word of God . Jehovah 's Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally , but accept parts of it as symbolic . They consider the Bible to be the final authority for all their beliefs , although sociologist Andrew Holden 's ethnographic study of the religion concluded that pronouncements of the Governing Body , through Watch Tower Society publications , carry almost as much weight as the Bible . Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended ; Witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and " private ideas " reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications , and are cautioned against reading other religious literature . Adherents are told to have " complete confidence " in the leadership , avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society 's literature , and " not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding . " The religion makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements .
Techniques like hand washing , wearing gowns , and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another . Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms . There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs , using a condom , and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise . Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important .
Peel , widely regarded as the father of modern policing , was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham , who called for a strong and centralized , but politically neutral , police force for the maintenance of social order , for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder . Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession , to organise it in a civilian fashion , and to make it answerable to the public .
The spread of Greek literature , mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome 's festivals and rituals , and the embellishment of its mythology . Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus , who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals . In the last century of the Republic , Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite , most of whom held - or had held - high office and traditional Roman priesthoods ; notably , Scaevola and the polymath Varro . For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus ' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction ; what the people believed was not itself the truth , but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with . Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives , the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals , and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult .
