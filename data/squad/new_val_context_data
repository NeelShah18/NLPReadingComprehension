A 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue . Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols ( menorah , lulav , etrog ) but the inscriptions are Greek . Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an ( excavated in 1960 ) . The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule ( shrine ) with cultic symbols . The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town ( see above ) . The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue . One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script .
In 1954 , Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America . He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India . Likewise , the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico . That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community ( EDC ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " Long faces do n't win wars " . As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC , he afterwards moved to restore West Germany , as a full NATO partner .
During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent , the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula . India continued to collide with Asia . The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene .
Disease can arise if the host 's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host . Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes . For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis . Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts . For example , less than 5 % of individuals infected with polio develop disease . On the other hand , some infectious agents are highly virulent . The prion causing mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected .
Despite its tropical wet and dry climate , extensive irrigation makes it a rich agricultural region . Its canal-irrigation system established by the British is the largest in the world . Wheat and cotton are the largest crops . Other crops include rice , sugarcane , millet , corn , oilseeds , pulses , vegetables , and fruits such as kinoo . Livestock and poultry production are also important . Despite past animosities , the rural masses in Punjab 's farms continue to use the Hindu calendar for planting and harvesting .
Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century , and at age 62 , was the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856 ( President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier ) . Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency ( The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor , Ulysses S. Grant , William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover ) .
Today , Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism . With approximately 80 million adherents , it constitutes the third most common Protestant confession after historically Pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism . The Lutheran World Federation , the largest global communion of Lutheran churches represents over 72 million people . Additionally , there are also many smaller bodies such as the International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference , as well as independent churches .
In the 5th-century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art . The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . The vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista . She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna . The mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna , Peter Chrysologus . They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message .
They formed , and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and group piety . Puritans adopted a Reformed theology , but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva . In church polity , some advocated for separation from all other Christians , in favor of autonomous gathered churches . These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church .
Modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment , carried both on the person and installed in vehicles , to co-ordinate their work , share information , and get help quickly . In recent years , vehicle-installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications , enabling easier dispatching of calls , criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds , and updating officers ' daily activity log and other , required reports on a real-time basis . Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights/torches , whistles , police notebooks and " ticket books " or citations .
In Rome , state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional . As princeps ( first citizen ) he must respect traditional Republican mores ; given virtually monarchic powers , he must restrain them . He was not a living divus but father of his country ( pater patriae ) , its pontifex maximus ( greatest priest ) and at least notionally , its leading Republican . When he died , his ascent to heaven , or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate . As a divus , he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine , garlands , incense , hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals . What he did in return for these favours is unknown , but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor . In Rome , official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius ; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that . In the crises leading up to the Dominate , Imperial titles and honours multiplied , reaching a peak under Diocletian . Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being ; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous .
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .
Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman religio . The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons , the apparent shrinking of the sun 's disc , two moons in a daylit sky , a cosmic battle between sun and moon , a rain of red-hot stones , a bloody sweat on statues , and blood in fountains and on ears of corn : all were expiated by sacrifice of " greater victims " . The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural ; sheep become goats , a hen become a cock ( and vice versa ) – these were expiated with " lesser victims " . The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina , singing a hymn to avert disaster : a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation . Religious restitution is proved only by Rome 's victory .
Kathmandu Metropolitan City ( KMC ) , in order to promote international relations has established an International Relations Secretariat ( IRC ) . KMC 's first international relationship was established in 1975 with the city of Eugene , Oregon , United States . This activity has been further enhanced by establishing formal relationships with 8 other cities : Motsumoto City of Japan , Rochester of the USA , Yangon ( formerly Rangoon ) of Myanmar , Xi'an of the People 's Republic of China , Minsk of Belarus , and Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea . KMC 's constant endeavor is to enhance its interaction with SAARC countries , other International agencies and many other major cities of the world to achieve better urban management and developmental programs for Kathmandu .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]
Others , such as Rep. Roger Sherman of Connecticut , believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers , which did not include establishing a national religion . Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions . However , the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment .
Greece is classified as an advanced , high-income economy , and was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( BSEC ) . The country joined what is now the European Union in 1981 . In 2001 Greece adopted the euro as its currency , replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachmae per euro . Greece is a member of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Trade Organization , and ranked 34th on Ernst & Young 's Globalization Index 2011 .
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar , but occasioned by events . The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows , though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event . During the late Republic , the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display , and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests . Under the Principate , all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control : the most lavish were subsidised by emperors , and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office . Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries . Others , such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era ( saeculum ) , became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity . That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part .
Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the Otranto Cathedral from 1166 , with mosaics tied into a tree of life , mostly still preserved . The scenes depict biblical characters , warrior kings , medieval beasts , allegories of the months and working activity . Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of Amalfi 's Norman Cathedral . The mosaic ambos in the churches of Ravello prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries .
In Rome , Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea , built 64 AD , and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites . However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression . The Roman church of Santa Costanza , which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family , has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault , which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration .
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
The U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it , due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal . Indeed , Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons , while reducing conventional forces , and with them the overall defense budget , a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162/2 . This approach became known as the " New Look " , and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953 .
The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa ( " all the sea " ) . All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus , very little is known of the Triassic open ocean . The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated . The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age ; in the U.S. , these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup . Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass , Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare ; despite their prominence in Western Europe , where the Triassic was first studied . In North America , for example , marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west . Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments , such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates .
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women , including many Armenian families . Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region , referred to as Artsakh ( see also Karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of Banants ( near Gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . The first time that the Armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh .
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
Protestantism has had an important influence on science . According to the Merton Thesis , there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other . The Merton Thesis has two separate parts : Firstly , it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly , it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society ( English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values . Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries . He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science . Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God 's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research .
There are more than 900 million Protestants worldwide , [ ad ] among approximately 2.4 billion Christians . [ ae ] In 2010 , a total of more than 800 million included 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa , 260 million in the Americas , 140 million in Asia-Pacific region , 100 million in Europe and 2 million in Middle East-North Africa . Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population . Various estimates put the percentage of Protestants in relation to the total number of world 's Christians at 33 % , 36 % , 36.7 % , and 40 % , while in relation to the world 's population at 11.6 % and 13 % .
The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS , TB and malaria . While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased , deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold . Childhood diseases include pertussis , poliomyelitis , diphtheria , measles and tetanus . Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths . In 2012 , approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections , making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world .

In Canada , " college " generally refers to a two-year , non-degree-granting institution , while " university " connotes a four-year , degree-granting institution . Universities may be sub-classified ( as in the Macleans rankings ) into large research universities with many PhD granting programs and medical schools ( for example , McGill University ) ; " comprehensive " universities that have some PhDs but are n't geared toward research ( such as Waterloo ) ; and smaller , primarily undergraduate universities ( such as St. Francis Xavier ) .
There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level . In 1773 , Isaac Backus , a prominent Baptist minister in New England , wrote against a state sanctioned religion , saying : " Now who can hear Christ declare , that his kingdom is , not of this world , and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him ? " He also observed that when " church and state are separate , the effects are happy , and they do not at all interfere with each other : but where they have been confounded together , no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued . " Thomas Jefferson 's influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786 , five years before the Bill of Rights .
Motorcycles are also commonly used , particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach , to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists and often in escort duties where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles . Bicycle patrols are used in some areas because they allow for more open interaction with the public . In addition , their quieter operation can facilitate approaching suspects unawares and can help in pursuing them attempting to escape on foot .
Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings , a far more prestigious artform , and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos . Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek , suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire ; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves . Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across North Africa , in places such as Carthage , and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis , Tunisia .
Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand years , since the time when Hayk , the legendary patriarch and founder of the first Armenian nation , led them to victory over Bel of Babylon . Today , with a population of 3.5 million , they not only constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia , but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis ( Հայաստանցի ) , meaning those that are from Armenia ( that is , those born and raised in Armenia ) . They , as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language . The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination , but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian .
French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign , and Eisenhower encountered a " preposterous situation " with the multiple rival factions in France . His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia , and intending to facilitate that objective , he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa , despite Darlan 's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces . The Allied leaders were " thunderstruck " by this from a political standpoint , though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation . Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move . Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle . Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies , considering it a criminal rather than a military matter . Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner , who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan 's commander-in-chief , and who had refused to postpone the execution .

When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
In 2014 , the airport received 15 new boarding bridges , totalling 28 in all . This was the main requirement made by the federal government , which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction . The group invested R $ 750 million in the project . In the same year , the number of parking spaces doubled , reaching three thousand . The airport 's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road . Furthermore , a VIP room was created on Terminal 1 's third floor . The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília 's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014 . Brasília has direct flights to all states of Brazil and direct international flights to Atlanta , Buenos Aires , Lisbon , Miami , Panama City , and Paris .
In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the Spirit . Generally , however , Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as Word of Faith , Toronto Blessing , Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival . Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the USA , in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is Terry Virgo .
Eventually , the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram , founding the city of Kathmandu . The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa , the sword of Manjushri . The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas . One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali ( in front of Singha Durbar ) . The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet , leading to tremendous growth in architecture . Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha , Kailaskut Bhawan , and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era . For example , the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan , the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma . The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well . The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era , both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas . Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia , creating religious art for their neighbors . For example , Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China . Bhrikuti , the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo , was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet .
A loblolly pine , known as the " Eisenhower Pine " , was located on Augusta 's 17th hole , approximately 210 yards ( 192 m ) from the Masters tee . President Dwight D. Eisenhower , an Augusta National member , hit the tree so many times that , at a 1956 club meeting , he proposed that it be cut down . Not wanting to offend the president , the club 's chairman , Clifford Roberts , immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request . The tree was removed in February 2014 after an ice storm caused it significant damage .
The province is home to several historical sites , including the Shalimar Gardens , the Lahore Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Rohtas Fort and the ruins of the ancient city of Harrapa . The Anarkali Market and Jahangir 's Tomb are prominent in the city of Lahore as is the Lahore Museum , while the ancient city of Taxila in the northwest was once a major centre of Buddhist and Hindu influence . Several important Sikh shrines are in the province , including the birthplace of the first Guru , Guru Nanak . ( born at Nankana Sahib ) . There are a few famous hill stations , including Murree , Bhurban , Patriata and Fort Munro .
Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university , Eisenhower was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services . About six months after his appointment , he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington . Two months later he fell ill , and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club . He returned to his post in New York in mid-May , and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state . Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape , he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950 , building financial support from Columbia Associates , an alumni association .
After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire ( Byzantine Empire ) and became the seat of the Exarchate of Ravenna . The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century . Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo . The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint Justinian I and Empress Theodora in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest . The mosaics of the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe were made around 549 . The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of San Michele in Affricisco , executed in 545–547 ( largely destroyed ; the remains in Berlin ) .
Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with the Senate Majority Leader , the House Majority Leader 's duties and prominence vary depending upon the style and power of the Speaker of the House . Typically , the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor . In some cases , Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker ; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert . In addition , Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor .
Beginning with the advent of beat match DJing , in which Bronx DJs ( Disc Jockeys ) including Grandmaster Flash , Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Kool Herc extended the breaks of funk records , a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk , disco and soul songs . As hip hop 's popularity grew , performers began speaking ( " rapping " ) in sync with the beats , and became known as MCs or emcees . The Herculoids , made up of Herc , Coke La Rock , and DJ Clark Kent , were the earliest to gain major fame . The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as " The Boogie Down Bronx " , or just " The Boogie Down " . This was hip-hop pioneer KRS-One 's inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP , or Boogie Down Productions , which included DJ Scott La Rock . Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include Big Pun , Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz , Camp Lo , Swizz Beatz , Drag-On , Fat Joe , Terror Squad and Corey Gunz .
The devotio was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make , promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods . Livy offers a detailed account of the devotio carried out by Decius Mus ; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson , all bearing the same name , also devoted themselves . Before the battle , Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate . When he offers sacrifice , the victim 's liver appears " damaged where it refers to his own fortunes " . Otherwise , the haruspex tells him , the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods . In a prayer recorded by Livy , Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus , charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks , and is killed ; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering . Had he failed to die , his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void , with possibly disastrous consequences . The act of devotio is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman gladiator .
Also , other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants . For example , torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740 , slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 ( William Wilberforce , Harriet Beecher Stowe , Abraham Lincoln - against Southern Protestants ) . Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law . The Geneva Convention , an important part of humanitarian international law , was largely the work of Henry Dunant , a reformed pietist . He also founded the Red Cross .
Rome 's diplomatic agreement with her neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine . and established on the Aventine in the " commune Latinorum Dianae templum " : At about the same time , the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount , its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome 's inclusive hegemony . Rome 's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the pomoerium : and the cult to Hercules at the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur . and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum : Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy , and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste . In 217 , Venus was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill .
In June 2007 , YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright . Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom , which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute . The system , which became known as Content ID , creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material , and stores it in a database . When a video is uploaded , it is checked against the database , and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found .
An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university . The University of Bologna adopted an academic charter , the Constitutio Habita , in 1158 or 1155 , which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education . Today this is claimed as the origin of " academic freedom " . This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988 , 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum , marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna 's foundation . The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow , drawing from all parts of the world .
The Bronx is referred to , both legally and colloquially , with a definite article , as the Bronx . ( The County of Bronx , unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx , does not place the immediately before Bronx in formal references , nor does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses . ) The name for this region , apparently after the Bronx River , first appeared in the Annexed District of the Bronx created in 1874 out of part of Westchester County and was continued in the Borough of the Bronx , which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898 . The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers . Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough 's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family , as in visiting The Broncks , The Bronck 's or The Broncks ' .
The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute , in the form of the Heinrich Heine Memorial , better known as the Lorelei Fountain from one of Heine 's best-known works ( 1838 ) . After Heine 's German birthplace of Düsseldorf had rejected , allegedly for anti-Semitic motives , a centennial monument to the radical German-Jewish poet ( 1797–1856 ) , his incensed German-American admirers , including Carl Schurz , started a movement to place one instead in Midtown Manhattan , at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street . However , this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism , aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art .
The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery , located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds , hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors , and regularly organizes exhibitions . It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art . Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery , located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house , giving an important insight into Nepali history . The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu , near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg , Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent , established Nepali painters . The Nepal Art Council Gallery , located in the Babar Mahal , on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions .
Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents . Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye . A cell is normally transparent under a microscope , and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background . Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size , shape , internal and external components and its associations with other cells . The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well . Two methods , the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain , are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease . The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups Firmicutes and Actinobacteria , both of which contain many significant human pathogens . The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia .
YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government , such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates ( 2007 ) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video , with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape . Describing the Arab Spring ( 2010- ) , sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist 's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using " Facebook to schedule the protests , Twitter to coordinate , and YouTube to tell the world . " In 2012 , more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the " Kony 2012 " video was posted to YouTube , with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video " will do more to lead to ( Kony 's ) demise than all other action combined . "
Many public high schools are located in the borough including the elite Bronx High School of Science , Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music , DeWitt Clinton High School , High School for Violin and Dance , Bronx Leadership Academy 2 , Bronx International High School , the School for Excellence , the Morris Academy for Collaborative Study , Wings Academy for young adults , The Bronx School for Law , Government and Justice , Validus Preparatory Academy , The Eagle Academy For Young Men , Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School , Bronx Academy of Letters , Herbert H. Lehman High School and High School of American Studies . The Bronx is also home to three of New York City 's most prestigious private , secular schools : Fieldston , Horace Mann , and Riverdale Country School .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
The court noted that it " is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America . " The lone dissenter , Justice Potter Stewart , objected to the court 's embrace of the " wall of separation " metaphor : " I think that the Court 's task , in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication , is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the " wall of separation , " a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution . "
Brasília has a tropical savanna climate ( Aw ) according to the Köppen system , with two distinct seasons : the rainy season , from October to April , and a dry season , from May to September . The average temperature is 20.6 °C ( 69.1 °F ) . September , at the end of the dry season , has the highest average maximum temperature , 28.3 °C ( 82.9 °F ) , has major and minor lower maximum average temperature , of 25.1 °C ( 77.2 °F ) and 12.9 °C ( 55.2 °F ) , respectively . Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C ( 72 °F ) . With 247.4 mm ( 9.7 in ) , January is the month with the highest rainfall of the year , while June is the lowest , with only 8.7 mm ( 0.3 in ) .
In 1997 , the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League , acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century . In 2006 , The New York Times reported that " construction cranes have become the borough 's new visual metaphor , replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings . " The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002 . Between 2002 and June 2007 , 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $ 4.8 billion has been invested in new housing . In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $ 965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed . Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx .
Thus , the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available . The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application , neither of which is insurmountable . The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods , such as some of the clostridial diseases ( tetanus and botulism ) . These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent neurotoxins . A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur , this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria .
In 1566 , the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited . By the 17th century , most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions . On July 9 , 1775 a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order . In 1808 , the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil , because of the French invasion of Portugal . King João VI established the " Intendência Geral de Polícia " ( General Police Intendancy ) for investigations . He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809 . In 1831 , after independence , each province started organizing its local " military police " , with order maintenance tasks . The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852 .
In 1963 , the Robbins Report on universities in the United Kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main " objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship . "
After a visit to Brasília , the French writer Simone de Beauvoir complained that all of its superquadras exuded " the same air of elegant monotony , " and other observers have equated the city 's large open lawns , plazas , and fields to wastelands . As the city has matured , some of these have gained adornments , and many have been improved by landscaping , giving some observers a sense of " humanized " spaciousness . Although not fully accomplished , the " Brasília utopia " has produced a city of relatively high quality of life , in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure ( the superquadras ) flanked by small commercial areas , bookstores and cafes ; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit .
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation ( malum carmen , or 'noisome metrical charm ' ) ; this included the " charming of crops from one field to another " ( excantatio frugum ) and any rite that sought harm or death to others . Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome 's divine and human communities ; although sometimes the recipients of public rites , these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the pomerium . Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze , during the hours of darkness . Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals . The barrier between private religious practices and " magic " is permeable , and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic : an old woman squats among a circle of younger women , sews up a fish-head , smears it with pitch , then pierces and roasts it to " bind hostile tongues to silence " . By this she invokes Tacita , the " Silent One " of the underworld .
Motorcycles are also commonly used , particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach , to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists and often in escort duties where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles . Bicycle patrols are used in some areas because they allow for more open interaction with the public . In addition , their quieter operation can facilitate approaching suspects unawares and can help in pursuing them attempting to escape on foot .
Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings , according to the principle do ut des ( " I give , that you might give " ) . Proper , respectful religio brought social harmony and prosperity . Religious neglect was a form of atheism : impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were vitia ( impious errors ) . Excessive devotion , fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were superstitio . Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger ( ira deorum ) and therefore harm the State . The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions , and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors . Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values .
Like the Speaker of the House , the Minority Leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position . When Nancy Pelosi , D-CA , became Minority Leader in the 108th Congress , she had served in the House nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip in the 107th Congress . When her predecessor , Richard Gephardt , D-MO , became minority leader in the 104th House , he had been in the House for almost 20 years , had served as chairman of the Democratic Caucus for four years , had been a 1988 presidential candidate , and had been majority leader from June 1989 until Republicans captured control of the House in the November 1994 elections . Gephardt 's predecessor in the minority leadership position was Robert Michel , R-IL , who became GOP Leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the House . Michel 's predecessor , Republican John Rhodes of Arizona , was elected Minority Leader in 1973 after 20 years of House service .
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli . Zwingli was a scholar and preacher , who in 1518 moved to Zurich . Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology , some unresolved differences kept them separate . A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism . The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther . A meeting was held in his castle in 1529 , now known as the Colloquy of Marburg , which has become infamous for its failure . The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine .
Protestantism is a form of Christian faith and practice which originated with the Protestant Reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church . It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom , together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy . Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism . [ b ] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical .
In November 2008 , 720p HD support was added . At the time of the 720p launch , the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9 . With this new feature , YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format . In November 2009 , 1080p HD support was added . In July 2010 , YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format , which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels . In June 2015 , support for 8K resolution was added , with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels .
Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages . The Abbey of Saint-Martial in Limoges , originally an important place of pilgrimage , was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s . A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century . It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble , probably taken from antique pavements . This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy , where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors . The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors . More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century .
Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant . Since 1900 , Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa , Asia , Oceania and Latin America . That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion . Much of the growth has occurred after World War II , when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred . According to one source , Protestants constituted respectively 2.5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % of Latin Americans , Africans and Asians . In 2000 , percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17 % , more than 27 % and 5.5 % , respectively . According to Mark A. Noll , 79 % of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910 , while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth . By 2010 , 59 % of Anglicans were found in Africa . In 2010 , more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany , while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined . Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe . China is home to world 's largest Protestant minority . [ af ]
Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine , mathematics , astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution . Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university , the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the scientific revolution . Historians such as Richard S. Westfall have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists . This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors , usually in princely courts , and associations with newly forming scientific societies .
Since the 19th century , many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or " gatekeeper " , sometimes described as the President 's Private Secretary , sometimes with no official title at all . Eisenhower formalized this role , introducing the office of White House Chief of Staff – an idea he borrowed from the United States Army . Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position . Initially , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter tried to operate without a chief of staff , but each eventually appointed one .
During the French Revolution , and soon after , in Germany ( by the Left Hegelians ) , humanism began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind , without attention to the transcendent or supernatural . The designation Religious Humanism refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . It is similar to Protestantism , although centered on human needs , interests , and abilities rather than the supernatural . In the Anglophone world , such modern , organized forms of humanism , which are rooted in the 18th-century Enlightenment , have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with classical learning and the liberal arts .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Rome offers no native creation myth , and little mythography to explain the character of its deities , their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world , but Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales ( immortal gods ) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth . There were gods of the upper heavens , gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between . Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them , but none were intrinsically , irredeemably foreign or alien . The political , cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad , inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults . At different times and in different places , the sphere of influence , character and functions of a divine being could expand , overlap with those of others , and be redefined as Roman . Change was embedded within existing traditions .
The city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu . Most of Kathmandu 's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism . There are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . English is understood by Kathmandu 's educated residents . Historic areas of Kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
In a video posted on July 21 , 2009 , YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos . The videos can be viewed in several different ways , including the common anaglyph ( cyan/red lens ) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect . The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows , columns or a checkerboard pattern , side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan , green/magenta or blue/yellow combination . In May 2011 , an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision .
In 1899 , the memorial , by the Berlin sculptor Ernst Gustav Herter ( 1846–1917 ) , finally came to rest , although subject to repeated vandalism , in the Bronx , at 164th Street and the Grand Concourse , or Joyce Kilmer Park near today 's Yankee Stadium . ( In 1999 , it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse . ) In 2007 , Christopher Gray of The New York Times described it as " a writhing composition in white Tyrolean marble depicting Lorelei , the mythical German figure , surrounded by mermaids , dolphins and seashells . "
For the popular taste however , light music , particularly Ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of Mehdi Hassan , Ghulam Ali , Nur Jehan , Malika Pukhraj , Farida Khanum , Roshen Ara Begum , and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan are well-known . Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . Luddi , Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living . Love legends of Heer Ranjha , Mirza Sahiban , Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles .
A pater familias was the senior priest of his household . He offered daily cult to his lares and penates , and to his di parentes/divi parentes at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth . His wife ( mater familias ) was responsible for the household 's cult to Vesta . In rural estates , bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines ( lararia ) and their deities . Household cults had state counterparts . In Vergil 's Aeneid , Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the lares and penates from Troy , along with the Palladium which was later installed in the temple of Vesta .
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The large villa rustica , which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century . The most important pieces are the Circus Scene , the 64m long Great Hunting Scene , the Little Hunt , the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis . The peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered . The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus , Alexander the Great 's Hunt and the Four Seasons .
With Eisenhower 's leadership and Dulles ' direction , CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries ; the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax , of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess , and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo ( Léopoldville ) . In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union . With Dulles ' recommendation , he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2 's at a cost of $ 35 million . The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba , which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out . "
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas , son of Venus , who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium , Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy . These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals , Rome 's female priesthood . Aeneas had been given refuge by King Evander , a Greek exile from Arcadia , to whom were attributed other religious foundations : he established the Ara Maxima , " Greatest Altar , " to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium , and he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia , an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
The mosaics of St. Peter 's often show lively Baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like Ciro Ferri , Guido Reni , Domenichino , Carlo Maratta , and many others . Raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting , the Transfiguration . Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter 's , including Giovanni Battista Calandra , Fabio Cristofari ( died 1689 ) , and Pietro Paolo Cristofari ( died 1743 ) . Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts .
Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks . In epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals . Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs , the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub . Thus , infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated ( Figure 1 ) . However , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs . The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method . Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001 .
To a large extent , the minority leader 's position is a 20th-century innovation . Prior to this time congressional parties were often relatively disorganized , so it was not always evident who functioned as the opposition floor leader . Decades went by before anything like the modern two-party congressional system emerged on Capitol Hill with official titles for those who were its official leaders . However , from the beginning days of Congress , various House members intermittently assumed the role of " opposition leader . " Some scholars suggest that Representative James Madison of Virginia informally functioned as the first " minority leader " because in the First Congress he led the opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton 's fiscal policies .
Bronx native Nancy Savoca 's 1989 comedy , True Love , explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding . The film , which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard as the betrothed couple , won the Grand Jury Prize at that year 's Sundance Film Festival . The CBS television sitcom Becker , 1998–2004 , was more ambiguous . The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker , a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients , co-workers , friends , and practically everything and everybody else in his world . It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx .
Brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports , sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings . Practitioners of such sports reveal that , because of the city 's dry weather , the city offers strong thermal winds and great " cloud-streets " , which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners . In 2003 , Brasília hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship , one of the categories of free flying . In August 2005 , the city hosted the 2nd stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
In the Middle Ages , the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related . Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . Luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in Scripture ; 1523 ) . Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to Calvin 's system of church self-government . This system was taken over by the other reformed churches .

The Chief Deputy Whip is the primary assistant to the whip , who is the chief vote counter for his or her party . The current chief deputy majority whip is Republican Patrick McHenry . Within the House Republican Conference , the chief deputy whip is the highest appointed position and often a launching pad for future positions in the House Leadership . The House Democratic Conference has multiple chief deputy whips , led by a Senior Chief Deputy Whip , which is the highest appointed position within the House Democratic Caucus . The current senior chief deputy minority whip , John Lewis , has held his post since 1991 .
The northern supercontinent of Laurasia began to break up , as Europe , Greenland and North America drifted apart . In western North America , mountain building started in the Eocene , and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts . In Europe , the Tethys Sea finally vanished , while the uplift of the Alps isolated its final remnant , the Mediterranean , and created another shallow sea with island archipelagos to the north . Though the North Atlantic was opening , a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . India continued its journey away from Africa and began its collision with Asia , creating the Himalayan orogeny .
There are 48 departments in Punjab government . Each Department is headed by a Provincial Minister ( Politician ) and a Provincial Secretary ( A civil servant of usually BPS-20 or BPS-21 ) . All Ministers report to the Chief Minister , who is the Chief Executive . All Secretaries report to the Chief Secretary of Punjab , who is usually a BPS-22 Civil Servant . The Chief Secretary in turn reports to the Chief Minister . In addition to these departments , there are several Autonomous Bodies and Attached Departments that report directly to either the Secretaries or the Chief Secretary .
Meanwhile , the authorities in Glasgow , Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 . Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the Brasília . The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into superquadras ( " superblocks " ) : groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of schools , retail stores , and open spaces . At the northern end of Lake Paranoá , separated from the inner city , is a peninsula with many fashionable homes , and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore . Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the artificial lake , but during early development private clubs , hotels , and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water . Set well apart from the city are satellite cities , including Gama , Ceilândia , Taguatinga , Núcleo Bandeirante , Sobradinho , and Planaltina . These cities , with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned .
The First Great Awakening was an evangelical and revitalization movement that swept through Protestant Europe and British America , especially the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s , leaving a permanent impact on American Protestantism . It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ . Pulling away from ritual , ceremony , sacramentalism and hierarchy , it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption , and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality .
Episcopalians and Presbyterians , as well as other WASPs , tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated ( having graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita ) than most other religious groups in United States , and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business , law and politics , especially the Republican Party . Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and the Astors , Rockefeller , Du Pont , Roosevelt , Forbes , Whitneys , the Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestant families .
Officially , human sacrifice was obnoxious " to the laws of gods and men . " The practice was a mark of the " Other " , attributed to Rome 's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls . Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty . A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes . Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain . Despite an empire-wide ban under Hadrian , human sacrifice may have continued covertly in North Africa and elsewhere .
The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the President of Brazil . It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília . As the seat of government , the term " Planalto " is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government . The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto . The President and his or her family do not live in it , rather in the official residence , the Palácio da Alvorada . Besides the President , senior advisors also have offices in the " Planalto , " including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff . The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios . The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer , creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília . The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures . The Palace is four stories high , and has an area of 36,000 m2 . Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex .
The original Latin word " universitas " refers in general to " a number of persons associated into one body , a society , company , community , guild , corporation , etc . " At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds , specialised " associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes , prelates , or the towns in which they were located " came to be denominated by this general term . Like other guilds , they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members .
Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere . After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526 , and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel , Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the " fallen city " of Geneva . His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life . After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559 , Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries . The faith continued to spread after Calvin 's death in 1563 .
The Government of Punjab is a provincial government in the federal structure of Pakistan , is based in Lahore , the capital of the Punjab Province . The Chief Minister of Punjab ( CM ) is elected by the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to serve as the head of the provincial government in Punjab , Pakistan . The current Chief Minister is Shahbaz Sharif , who became the Chief Minister of Punjab as being restored after Governor 's rule starting from 25 February 2009 to 30 March 2009 . Thereafter got re-elected as a result of 11 May 2013 elections . The Provincial Assembly of the Punjab is a unicameral legislature of elected representatives of the province of Punjab , which is located in Lahore in eastern Pakistan . The Assembly was established under Article 106 of the Constitution of Pakistan as having a total of 371 seats , with 66 seats reserved for women and eight reserved for non-Muslims .
Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth , status and religious context . In Cicero 's time , the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation . The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre , Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar , and the family at the site of the cremation . For the less well-off , inhumation with " a libation of wine , incense , and fruit or crops was sufficient " . Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead : the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living . The ashes ( or body ) were entombed or buried . On the eighth day of mourning , the family offered further sacrifice , this time on the ground ; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld . They had become one of the di Manes , who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia , a multi-day festival of remembrance in February .
The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century ( a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution ) has been little researched . Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy , calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations . Industrial activity , ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was evident , mainly in Ermoupolis and Piraeus . Nonetheless , Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826 , 1843 , 1860 and 1894 .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .

A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law , protect property , and limit civil disorder . Their powers include the legitimized use of force . The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors ; however , gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing .
Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings , individually and collectively , and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence ( rationalism , empiricism ) over acceptance of dogma or superstition . The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it . Generally , however , humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress . In modern times , humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism , and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world .
Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body . The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " God 's organization " . It also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by Satan the Devil " and would " cause division " . Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " .
Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages : natural philosophy , logic , medicine , theology , mathematics , astronomy ( and astrology ) , law , grammar and rhetoric . Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum , while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship . The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs can not be underestimated . Once humanist professors joined the university faculty , they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis . Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction , to translate and interpret classical texts , and to live honorable lives . Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts , as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts . Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno , Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts . The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship . For instance , Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen , whose ideas he verified through his own dissections . In law , Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective , while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist . Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts , which was important for the reform at Protestant universities . Galileo Galilei , who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua , and Martin Luther , who taught at the University of Wittenberg ( as did Melanchthon ) , also had humanist training . The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university ; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs , syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship .
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
Promote and Publicize the Party 's Agenda . An important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independents and swing voters . Despite the minority leader 's restricted ability to set the House 's agenda , there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities . For example , the minority leader may employ , or threaten to use , discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor . If he or she is able to attract the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting majority party supporters , he or she can force minority initiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership . As a GOP minority leader once said , the challenges he confronted are to " keep our people together , and to look for votes on the other side . "
The Licchavis from the Indo-Gangetic plain migrated north and defeated the Kiratas , establishing the Licchavi dynasty . During this era , following the genocide of Shakyas in Lumbini by Virudhaka , the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery in Sankhu masquerading as Koliyas . From Sankhu , they migrated to Yambu and Yengal ( Lanjagwal and Manjupattan ) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu . This created the basis of Newar Buddhism , which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world . With their migration , Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram during most of the Licchavi era .
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus , then capital of the Arab Caliphate . The mosque was built between 706 and 715 . The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building . This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration . The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees , flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background . The mosaics include no human figures , which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works . The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard , called the " Barada Panel " after the river Barada . It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world , at over 4 m2 . In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively , and many mosaics were lost , although some have been restored since .
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader . He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " Rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik 's Cubes . Although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well .
Despite popular conceptions promoted by movies and television , many US police departments prefer not to maintain officers in non-patrol bureaus and divisions beyond a certain period of time , such as in the detective bureau , and instead maintain policies that limit service in such divisions to a specified period of time , after which officers must transfer out or return to patrol duties . [ citation needed ] This is done in part based upon the perception that the most important and essential police work is accomplished on patrol in which officers become acquainted with their beats , prevent crime by their presence , respond to crimes in progress , manage crises , and practice their skills .

Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church ’ s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
He assumed duties again at Camp Meade , Maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . His schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S. Patton , Sereno E. Brett , and other senior tank leaders . Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he relented .
As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft , according to Foucault the police had an administrative , economic and social duty ( " procuring abundance " ) . It was in charge of demographic concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d'état and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population ( and unwittingly supervising the population ) , which , according to mercantilist theory , was to be the main strength of the state . Thus , its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns , urban planning ( which was important because of the miasma theory of disease ; thus , cemeteries were moved out of town , etc . ) , and surveillance of prices .
President Truman , symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president , again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat . It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans . A " Draft Eisenhower " movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft . The effort was a long struggle ; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate , and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President . Henry Cabot Lodge , who served as his campaign manager , and others succeeded in convincing him , and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time . Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination , having won critical delegate votes from Texas . Eisenhower 's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan , " I Like Ike " . It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt 's policy at Yalta and against Truman 's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated . In defeating Taft for the nomination , it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party ; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose . Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike 's more advanced age .
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered . The most important one was uncovered in 1990 . It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual . The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century . In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed . They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals , and personifications of the Seasons , Ocean , Earth and Wisdom .
In Canada , " college " generally refers to a two-year , non-degree-granting institution , while " university " connotes a four-year , degree-granting institution . Universities may be sub-classified ( as in the Macleans rankings ) into large research universities with many PhD granting programs and medical schools ( for example , McGill University ) ; " comprehensive " universities that have some PhDs but are n't geared toward research ( such as Waterloo ) ; and smaller , primarily undergraduate universities ( such as St. Francis Xavier ) .
An error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece ’ s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives ’ deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to " hide " 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece ’ s Eurozone entry .
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977–1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992–2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " .
From 1920 , Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals – Fox Conner , John J. Pershing , Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall . He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone , where , joined by Mamie , he served until 1924 . Under Conner 's tutelage , he studied military history and theory ( including Carl von Clausewitz 's On War ) , and later cited Conner 's enormous influence on his military thinking , saying in 1962 that " Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew . " Conner 's comment on Eisenhower was , " [ He ] is one of the most capable , efficient and loyal officers I have ever met . " On Conner 's recommendation , in 1925–26 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers . He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning , Georgia , until 1927 .
The original Latin word " universitas " refers in general to " a number of persons associated into one body , a society , company , community , guild , corporation , etc . " At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds , specialised " associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes , prelates , or the towns in which they were located " came to be denominated by this general term . Like other guilds , they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members .
The province is home to several historical sites , including the Shalimar Gardens , the Lahore Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Rohtas Fort and the ruins of the ancient city of Harrapa . The Anarkali Market and Jahangir 's Tomb are prominent in the city of Lahore as is the Lahore Museum , while the ancient city of Taxila in the northwest was once a major centre of Buddhist and Hindu influence . Several important Sikh shrines are in the province , including the birthplace of the first Guru , Guru Nanak . ( born at Nankana Sahib ) . There are a few famous hill stations , including Murree , Bhurban , Patriata and Fort Munro .
The Bronx /ˈbrɒŋks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs ( counties ) of New York City in the state of New York , located south of Westchester County . Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River , as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens . Of the five boroughs , the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and , with a land area of 42 square miles ( 109 km2 ) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014 , has the fourth largest land area , the fourth highest population , and the third-highest population density .
The Bronx is referred to , both legally and colloquially , with a definite article , as the Bronx . ( The County of Bronx , unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx , does not place the immediately before Bronx in formal references , nor does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses . ) The name for this region , apparently after the Bronx River , first appeared in the Annexed District of the Bronx created in 1874 out of part of Westchester County and was continued in the Borough of the Bronx , which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898 . The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers . Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough 's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family , as in visiting The Broncks , The Bronck 's or The Broncks ' .
The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU . Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor . Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013 , the third in Bulgaria , in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in former Yugoslavia and in other Balkan countries .
The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx , resulting in a major boom in residential construction . Among these groups , many Irish Americans , Italian Americans and especially Jewish Americans settled here . In addition , French , German , Polish and other immigrants moved into the borough . The Jewish population also increased notably during this time . In 1937 , according to Jewish organizations , 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx ( 43.9 % of the borough 's population ) , while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011 . Many synagogues still stand in the Bronx , but most have been converted to other uses .
Rome had no separate priestly caste or class . The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices , officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes . Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as haruspices and oracles were available for consultation . In household cult , the paterfamilias functioned as priest , and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants . Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise . The earliest public priesthoods were probably the flamines ( the singular is flamen ) , attributed to king Numa : the major flamines , dedicated to Jupiter , Mars and Quirinus , were traditionally drawn from patrician families . Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity , whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some . Flamines were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity ; Jupiter 's flamen in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career .
In 2002 , a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under God . " In reaction to the case , Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . Rather , a five-justice majority held that Newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ( Amendment XIV ) is one of the post-Civil War amendments , intended to secure rights for former slaves . It includes the due process and equal protection clauses among others . The amendment introduces the concept of incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states . While it has not been fully implemented , the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure , through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause , the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states .
There are 48 departments in Punjab government . Each Department is headed by a Provincial Minister ( Politician ) and a Provincial Secretary ( A civil servant of usually BPS-20 or BPS-21 ) . All Ministers report to the Chief Minister , who is the Chief Executive . All Secretaries report to the Chief Secretary of Punjab , who is usually a BPS-22 Civil Servant . The Chief Secretary in turn reports to the Chief Minister . In addition to these departments , there are several Autonomous Bodies and Attached Departments that report directly to either the Secretaries or the Chief Secretary .

In the United States , August Vollmer introduced other reforms , including education requirements for police officers . O.W . Wilson , a student of Vollmer , helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita , Kansas , and later in the Chicago Police Department . Strategies employed by O.W . Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption , establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force , a strict merit system for promotions within the department , and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers . During the professionalism era of policing , law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime , rather than broader focus on crime prevention .
The Second Great Awakening began around 1790 . It gained momentum by 1800 . After 1820 , membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . It was past its peak by the late 1840s . It has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .
South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene , bringing a nearly complete end to South America 's distinctive marsupial faunas . The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures , since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began , with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean . Africa 's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea , cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean . Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia . Near the end of the Pliocene , about 2.58 million years ago ( the start of the Quaternary Period ) , the current ice age began . The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000–100,000 years .
Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university , Eisenhower was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services . About six months after his appointment , he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington . Two months later he fell ill , and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club . He returned to his post in New York in mid-May , and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state . Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape , he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950 , building financial support from Columbia Associates , an alumni association .
A noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement . Sprung from Methodist and Wesleyan roots , it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles . From there it spread around the world , carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there . These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history , such as seen in the two Great Awakenings . Pentecostalism , which in turn birthed the Charismatic movement within already established denominations , continues to be an important force in Western Christianity .
In December 1943 , President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . The following month , he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 . He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord , the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany .
Brasília ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ bɾaˈziljɐ ] ) is the federal capital of Brazil and seat of government of the Federal District . The city is located atop the Brazilian highlands in the country 's center-western region . It was founded on April 21 , 1960 , to serve as the new national capital . Brasília and its metro ( encompassing the whole of the Federal District ) had a population of 2,556,149 in 2011 , making it the 4th most populous city in Brazil . Among major Latin American cities , Brasília has the highest GDP per capita at R $ 61,915 ( US $ 36,175 ) .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to God 's kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with Christ as king . They remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues . Although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . They do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter , nor do they observe birthdays , nationalistic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus . They feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit . Their position is that these traditional holidays reflect Satan 's control over the world . Witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations .
The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges , running south to north . The West Bronx has older apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as Riverdale and Fieldston . It includes New York City 's fourth largest park : Van Cortlandt Park along the Westchester-Bronx border . The Grand Concourse , a wide boulevard , runs through it , north to south .
All YouTube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration . Users who have a good track record of complying with the site 's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length , which requires verifying the account , normally through a mobile phone . When YouTube was launched in 2005 , it was possible to upload long videos , but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films . The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010 . If an up-to-date browser version is used , videos greater than 20 GB can be uploaded .
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
Tourism is considered another important industry in Nepal . This industry started around 1950 , as the country 's political makeup changed and ended the country 's isolation from the rest of the world . In 1956 , air transportation was established and the Tribhuvan Highway , between Kathmandu and Raxaul ( at India 's border ) , was started . Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity ; some of these include the Tourism Development Board , the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department . Furthermore , Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations . Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity . The hotel industry , travel agencies , training of tourist guides , and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal , and in Kathmandu in particular .
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome 's intellectual elite , but the more obscure they were , the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform , which often cloaked autocratic innovation , nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era , Ovid . In his Fasti , a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June , Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore , popular customs , and religious practice that is by turns imaginative , entertaining , high-minded , and scurrilous ; not a priestly account , despite the speaker 's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet , but a work of description , imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia , Consualia , and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March , where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people . But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events , indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances . In the later Empire under Christian rule , the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar , alongside at least some of the traditional festivals .
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus , then capital of the Arab Caliphate . The mosque was built between 706 and 715 . The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building . This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration . The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees , flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background . The mosaics include no human figures , which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works . The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard , called the " Barada Panel " after the river Barada . It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world , at over 4 m2 . In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively , and many mosaics were lost , although some have been restored since .
Once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to France . This time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed , just a week before departure . Completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time , despite being given the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at home . [ citation needed ] In World War II , rivals who had combat service in the first great war ( led by Gen. Bernard Montgomery ) sought to denigrate Eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty , despite his stateside experience establishing a camp , completely equipped , for thousands of troops , and developing a full combat training schedule .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church ’ s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
In some countries , YouTube is completely blocked , either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest , the run-up to an election , or in response to upcoming political anniversaries . In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open , but access to specific videos is blocked . In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video , YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service .
In November 1956 , Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British , French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis , receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations , and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt . Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs , which were published in 1965 .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
Towards the end of the Republic , religious and political offices became more closely intertwined ; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative . Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political , military and priestly powers ; at first temporarily , then for his lifetime . He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome 's major priesthoods , including that of pontifex maximus ; as he invented none , he could claim them as traditional honours . His reforms were represented as adaptive , restorative and regulatory , rather than innovative ; most notably his elevation ( and membership ) of the ancient Arvales , his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality . Augustus obtained the pax deorum , maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation . This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors .
During the Eocene ( 56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago ) , the continents continued to drift toward their present positions . At the beginning of the period , Australia and Antarctica remained connected , and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters , distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high . But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma , the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica , and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents . The Antarctic region cooled down , and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze , sending cold water and ice floes north , reinforcing the cooling . The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago . [ citation needed ]
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation ( malum carmen , or 'noisome metrical charm ' ) ; this included the " charming of crops from one field to another " ( excantatio frugum ) and any rite that sought harm or death to others . Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome 's divine and human communities ; although sometimes the recipients of public rites , these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the pomerium . Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze , during the hours of darkness . Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals . The barrier between private religious practices and " magic " is permeable , and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic : an old woman squats among a circle of younger women , sews up a fish-head , smears it with pitch , then pierces and roasts it to " bind hostile tongues to silence " . By this she invokes Tacita , the " Silent One " of the underworld .
Davies identifies Paine 's The Age of Reason as " the link between the two major narratives of what Jean-François Lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation " : the rationalism of the 18th-century Philosophes and the radical , historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach . " The first is political , largely French in inspiration , and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty ' . The second is philosophical , German , seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge , and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation . The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond , and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms . Homo homini deus est ( " The human being is a god to humanity " or " god is nothing [ other than ] the human being to himself " ) , Feuerbach had written .
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
In the United States and elsewhere in the world , there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations , especially those that are more exclusively evangelical , and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches . In the post–World War I era , Liberal Christianity was on the rise , and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well . In the post–World War II era , the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America 's seminaries and church structures .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel . After a few months with no success by the French , he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes . Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval . When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954 , Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the Vice President and the head of NCS .
Historically , the name Armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people . It was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient Armenia . The earliest attestations of the exonym Armenia date around the 6th century BC . In his trilingual Behistun Inscription dated to 517 BC , Darius I the Great of Persia refers to Urashtu ( in Babylonian ) as Armina ( in Old Persian ; Armina ( ) and Harminuya ( in Elamite ) . In Greek , Αρμένιοι " Armenians " is attested from about the same time , perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to Hecataeus of Miletus ( 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians .
With the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century , wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses . The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived , but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana , both from the 4th century , still exist . The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus , which symbolizes transformation or change , and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum , the original function of this building . In another great Constantinian basilica , the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved . The so-called Tomb of the Julii , near the crypt beneath St Peter 's Basilica , is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations . The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki , converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century , was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics . Only fragments survive of the original decoration , especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer , in front of complex architectural fantasies .
The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture . The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices . The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings . In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site ( WHS ) . The seven monuments zones cover an area of 188.95 hectares ( 466.9 acres ) , with the buffer zone extending to 239.34 hectares ( 591.4 acres ) . The Seven Monument Zones ( Mzs ) inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka , Patan and Bhaktapur , Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan , the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
Constantine 's nephew Julian rejected the " Galilean madness " of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism , Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult . Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism , attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights . He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem 's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the " irrational impieties " of Christian doctrine . His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate , with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia , after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned . The empire once again fell under Christian control , this time permanently .
Organizations including Viacom , Mediaset , and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube , claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material . Viacom , demanding $ 1 billion in damages , said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed " an astounding 1.5 billion times " . YouTube responded by stating that it " goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works " .
In 2002 , a three judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under God . " In reaction to the case , Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow , both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . Rather , a five-justice majority held that Newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
Greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The Greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to Japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . Additionally , Greece represents 39.52 % of all of the European Union 's dwt . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .

Today , this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader . Less commonly , it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself . The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways . Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism , though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole . Broadly speaking , Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life . This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
Praça dos Três Poderes ( Portuguese for Square of the Three Powers ) is a plaza in Brasília . The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza : the Executive , represented by the Palácio do Planalto ( presidential office ) ; the Legislative , represented by the National Congress ( Congresso Nacional ) ; and the Judicial branch , represented by the Supreme Federal Court ( Supremo Tribunal Federal ) . It is a tourist attraction in Brasília , designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously .
After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire ( Byzantine Empire ) and became the seat of the Exarchate of Ravenna . The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century . Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo . The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint Justinian I and Empress Theodora in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest . The mosaics of the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe were made around 549 . The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of San Michele in Affricisco , executed in 545–547 ( largely destroyed ; the remains in Berlin ) .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century . Some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club . Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . Some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as Ducks Unlimited , Pheasants Forever , or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation . Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx ; in addition , a La Quinta Inn that has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront . The Kingsbridge Armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center . Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway 's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College . The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost US $ 350–500 million .
Meanwhile , the authorities in Glasgow , Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 . Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
In 295 , a certain Maximilian refused military service ; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath . Both were executed for treason ; both were Christians . At some time around 302 , a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian 's domus and a subsequent ( but undated ) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered a series of edicts against Christianity . The first ( 303 AD ) " ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts , forbade services to be held , degraded ofﬁcials who were Christians , re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians , and reduced the legal rights of all Christians ... [ Physical ] or capital punishments were not imposed on them " but soon after , several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed . The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice . An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods , in terms that recall the Decian edict .
With the opening of the tourist industry after the change in the political scenario of Nepal in 1950 , the hotel industry drastically improved . Now Kathmandu boasts several luxury such as the Hyatt Regency , Dwarika 's , theYak & Yeti , The Everest Hotel , Hotel Radisson , Hotel De L'Annapurna , The Malla Hotel , Shangri-La Hotel ( which is not operated by the Shangri-La Hotel Group ) and The Shanker Hotel . There are several four-star hotels such as Hotel Vaishali , Hotel Narayani , The Blue Star and Grand Hotel . The Garden Hotel , Hotel Ambassador , and Aloha Inn are among the three-star hotels in Kathmandu . Hotels like Hyatt Regency , De L'Annapurna and Hotel Yak & Yeti are among the five-star hotels providing casinos as well .
The Earth of the early Archean ( 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago ) may have had a different tectonic style . During this time , the Earth 's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form . Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter , that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today , resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material . This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down . Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events .
From 1966 , Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Christ 's thousand-year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . The number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974 . By 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . Membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . Watch Tower Society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
During the same court battle , Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site . The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which called the court ruling " a setback to privacy rights " . In June 2010 , Viacom 's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment , with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling .
The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma . During the early Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana ; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow , while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period , when Gondwana itself rifted apart . The Tethys Sea closed , and the Neotethys basin appeared . Climates were warm , with no evidence of glaciation . As in the Triassic , there was apparently no land near either pole , and no extensive ice caps existed . The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe , where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas ; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen . In contrast , the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic , with few outcrops at the surface . Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic , most exposed sediments from this period are continental , such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation . The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic , marking the Nevadan orogeny . Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia , India , South America , Japan , Australasia and the United Kingdom .
Gephardt added that " inclusion and empowerment of the people on the line have to be done to get the best performance " from the minority party . Other techniques for fostering party harmony include the appointment of task forces composed of partisan colleagues with conflicting views to reach consensus on issues ; the creation of new leadership positions as a way to reach out and involve a greater diversity of partisans in the leadership structure ; and daily meetings in the Leader 's office ( or at breakfast , lunch , or dinner ) to lay out floor strategy or political objectives for the minority party .
However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli . Zwingli was a scholar and preacher , who in 1518 moved to Zurich . Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology , some unresolved differences kept them separate . A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism . The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther . A meeting was held in his castle in 1529 , now known as the Colloquy of Marburg , which has become infamous for its failure . The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine .
