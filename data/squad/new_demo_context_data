Wonder Woman, a movie that just released just a few months ago, is a fantastic, amazing, kick butt movie! It tells the story of Diana, princess of Themsycira, who lives with Amazons (woman warriors who train in martial arts) and she becomes the strongest of the Amazonian warriors. She later saves Cap. Steve Trevor, who crash lands on the island. She helps him leave the island, and goes to the warfront herself. Throughout the movie, Diana fearlessly charges into the war, saving a village in the process. At the movie climax, Diana fights against Ares, the God of War, and she defeats him. Unfortunately, Steve Trevor sacrifices himself for the cause. At the end, though, Diana becomes Wonder Woman.
