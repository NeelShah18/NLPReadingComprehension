With the opening of the tourist industry after the change in the political scenario of Nepal in 1950 , the hotel industry drastically improved . Now Kathmandu boasts several luxury such as the Hyatt Regency , Dwarika 's , theYak & Yeti , The Everest Hotel , Hotel Radisson , Hotel De L'Annapurna , The Malla Hotel , Shangri-La Hotel ( which is not operated by the Shangri-La Hotel Group ) and The Shanker Hotel . There are several four-star hotels such as Hotel Vaishali , Hotel Narayani , The Blue Star and Grand Hotel . The Garden Hotel , Hotel Ambassador , and Aloha Inn are among the three-star hotels in Kathmandu . Hotels like Hyatt Regency , De L'Annapurna and Hotel Yak & Yeti are among the five-star hotels providing casinos as well .
Speaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress , with results , " often the reverse of what he has desired " because Members of Congress , " resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'The Chief wants this ' . The administration never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking . "
Protestantism has had an important influence on science . According to the Merton Thesis , there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other . The Merton Thesis has two separate parts : Firstly , it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly , it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society ( English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values . Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries . He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science . Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God 's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research .
Greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The Greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to Japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . Additionally , Greece represents 39.52 % of all of the European Union 's dwt . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state , allowing a variety of religions to flourish . Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a " remarkable religiosity " in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on " a sort of civic religion , " which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who " expects better of us . " Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience . He calls this approach the " genius of religious sentiment in the United States . "
The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome 's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays . In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) from Pessinus , installed on the Palatine in 191 BC . The mystery cult to Bacchus followed ; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC . Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium : temples were dedicated to Juventas ( Hebe ) in 191 BC , Diana ( Artemis ) in 179 BC , Mars ( Ares ) in 138 BC ) , and to Bona Dea , equivalent to Fauna , the female counterpart of the rural Faunus , supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia . Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman Penates as forms of the Greek Dioscuri . The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma ( identified with Roman Bellona , the Egyptian mystery-goddess Isis and Persian Mithras . )
In the late 1130s , Arnold of Brescia , an Italian canon regular became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church . After his death , his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency among Arnoldists , and later more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans , though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation . In the early 1170s , Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians . He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church . By 1215 , the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution . Despite that , the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy , as a part of the wider Reformed tradition .
After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD , Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats , who were later persecuted and killed . From that point on , Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution . During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century , “ contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms ” , regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems . Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless , who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State , and therefore threatened its existence . The majority of Rome ’ s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism ; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework . Christians saw these ungodly practices as a primary cause of economic and political crisis .
Following the German unconditional surrender , Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U.S . Occupation Zone , based at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main . He had no responsibility for the other three zones , controlled by Britain , France and the Soviet Union , except for the city of Berlin , which was managed by the Four-Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body . Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps , he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials . He reclassified German prisoners of war ( POWs ) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces ( DEFs ) , who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention . Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) in directive JCS 1067 , but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization . In response to the devastation in Germany , including food shortages and an influx of refugees , he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment . His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains , while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis .
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole . An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct . Jainism is practiced by a small community . A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar , where Jains practice their faith . According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal , there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley . They have a National Office located in Shantinagar , Baneshwor . The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu . Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of Nepal . [ citation needed ] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches . Christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies , who had converted to Christianity while in service , on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion . They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu , in particular .
Bronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns ; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae , and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës , Albania in 1916 , is an early figural example ; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC . Mythological subjects , or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy , were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design , with strongly emphasized borders . Pliny the Elder mentions the artist Sosus of Pergamon by name , describing his mosaics of the food left on a floor after a feast and of a group of doves drinking from a bowl . Both of these themes were widely copied .
Protestantism spread in Europe during the 16th century . Lutheranism spread from Germany into its surrounding areas , [ c ] Denmark , [ d ] Norway , [ e ] Sweden , [ f ] Finland , [ g ] Prussia , [ h ] Latvia , [ i ] , Estonia , [ j ] and Iceland , [ k ] as well as other smaller territories . Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions , [ l ] Hungary , [ m ] the Netherlands , [ n ] Scotland , [ o ] Switzerland , [ p ] and France [ q ] by such reformers as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . Arminianism [ r ] gained supporters in the Netherlands and parts of Germany . In 1534 , King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England [ s ] after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon ; this opened the door to reformational ideas , notably during the following reign of Edward VI , through Thomas Cranmer , Richard Hooker , Matthew Parker and other theologians . There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation—a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers—which gave rise to Anabaptist , Moravian , and other Pietistic movements . In later centuries , Protestants developed their own culture , which made major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and other fields .

Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909 . As a freshman , he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin , and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening . The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it , and miraculously recovered , though he had to repeat his freshman year . He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college , though they lacked the funds . They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions .
From an institutional perspective , the rules of the House assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader . For example , Rule XII , clause 6 , grant the minority leader ( or his designee ) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions ; Rule II , clause 6 , states the Inspector General shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the Speaker , majority leader , and minority leader ; and Rule XV , clause 6 , provides that the Speaker , after consultation with the minority leader , may place legislation on the Corrections Calendar . The minority leader also has other institutional duties , such as appointing individuals to certain federal entities .
Within the diasporan Armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of Armenians . For example , Armenians who originate from Iran are referred to as Parskahay ( Պարսկահայ ) , while Armenians from Lebanon are usually referred to as Lipananahay ( Լիբանանահայ ) . Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the Western dialect of the Armenian language . This dialect has considerable differences with Eastern Armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . Eastern Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine , Russia , and Georgia ( where they form a majority in the Samtskhe-Javakheti province ) . In diverse communities ( such as in Canada and the U.S. ) where many different kinds of Armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
Active in the early 1920s , F.C.S . Schiller labelled his work " humanism " but for Schiller the term referred to the pragmatist philosophy he shared with William James . In 1929 , Charles Francis Potter founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included Julian Huxley , John Dewey , Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann . Potter was a minister from the Unitarian tradition and in 1930 he and his wife , Clara Cook Potter , published Humanism : A New Religion . Throughout the 1930s , Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as , women ’ s rights , access to birth control , " civil divorce laws " , and an end to capital punishment .
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior . Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area . This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission . It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates . Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate . There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load , making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism , which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections . There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load . Thus , polygny may also be due to a lower male : female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases . Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .
In the Iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople ( after 740 ) . There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea . The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules ( 787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively , the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx : The Hub , Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard . The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District ( B.I.D . ) , in The Hub , is the retail heart of the South Bronx , located where four roads converge : East 149th Street , Willis , Melrose and Third Avenues . It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven . The Hub has been called " the Broadway of the Bronx " , being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx . It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density . In configuration , it resembles a miniature Times Square , a spatial " bow-tie " created by the geometry of the street . The Hub is part of Bronx Community Board 1 .
Colquhoun 's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives . Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street , the river police were full-time , salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees . His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing ; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames . Colquhoun 's innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel 's " new " police three decades later .
All Protestant denominations reject the notion of papal supremacy over the Church universal and generally deny the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , but they disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . The various denominations generally emphasize the priesthood of all believers , the doctrine of justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than by or with good works , and a belief in the Bible alone ( rather than with Catholic tradition ) as the highest authority in matters of faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The " Five solae " summarize the reformers ' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church of the day .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church ’ s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal . Of these , Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone ( elevation ranging from 1,200–2,300 metres ( 3,900–7,500 ft ) ) , where the climate is fairly temperate , atypical for the region . This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100–3,300 metres ( 6,900–10,800 ft ) . Under Köppen 's climate classification , portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate ( Cwa ) , while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate . In the Kathmandu Valley , which is representative of its valley 's climate , the average summer temperature varies from 28–30 °C ( 82–86 °F ) . The average winter temperature is 10.1 °C ( 50.2 °F ) .
As of August 2015 , Jehovah 's Witnesses report an average of 8.2 million publishers—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 118,016 congregations . In 2015 , these reports indicated over 1.93 billion hours spent in preaching and " Bible study " activity . Since the mid-1990s , the number of peak publishers has increased from 4.5 million to 8.2 million . In the same year , they conducted " Bible studies " with over 9.7 million individuals , including those conducted by Witness parents with their children . Jehovah 's Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 1.5 % per year .
During this early period , it was more usual that neither major party grouping ( Federalists and Democratic-Republicans ) had an official leader . In 1813 , for instance , a scholar recounts that the Federalist minority of 36 Members needed a committee of 13 " to represent a party comprising a distinct minority " and " to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause . " In 1828 , a foreign observer of the House offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership on Capitol Hill :
The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977–1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992–2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " .
Roman religion was thus practical and contractual , based on the principle of do ut des , " I give that you might give . " Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer , ritual , and sacrifice , not on faith or dogma , although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs . Even the most skeptical among Rome 's intellectual elite such as Cicero , who was an augur , saw religion as a source of social order . For ordinary Romans , religion was a part of daily life . Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family 's domestic deities were offered . Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city . The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances . Women , slaves , and children all participated in a range of religious activities . Some public rituals could be conducted only by women , and women formed what is perhaps Rome 's most famous priesthood , the state-supported Vestals , who tended Rome 's sacred hearth for centuries , until disbanded under Christian domination .
According to a story that has often been repeated in the media , Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005 , after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen 's apartment in San Francisco . Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred , but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party " was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible " .
The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party , and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader . Unlike the Majority Leader , the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress . If the Minority Leader 's party takes control of the House , and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats , the Minority Leader is usually the party 's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress , while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader . The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues .
Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells ( defixiones ) , magical papyri and so-called " voodoo dolls " from a very early era . Around 250 defixiones have been recovered just from Roman Britain , in both urban and rural settings . Some seek straightforward , usually gruesome revenge , often for a lover 's offense or rejection . Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs , in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate , and promise a portion of the value ( usually small ) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration . None of these defixiones seem produced by , or on behalf of the elite , who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice . Similar traditions existed throughout the empire , persisting until around the 7th century AD , well into the Christian era .
The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored , a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists . The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture , introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo . The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks ( interpretatio graeca ) , adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art . Etruscan religion was also a major influence , particularly on the practice of augury .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
In the American Old West , policing was often of very poor quality . [ citation needed ] The Army often provided some policing alongside poorly resourced sheriffs and temporarily organized posses . [ citation needed ] Public organizations were supplemented by private contractors , notably the Pinkerton National Detective Agency , which was hired by individuals , businessmen , local governments and the federal government . At its height , the Pinkerton Agency 's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army . [ citation needed ]
Devise Minority Party Strategies . The minority leader , in consultation with other party colleagues , has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives . The options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances , such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party . For instance , a majority party riven by internal dissension , as occurred during the early 1900s when Progressive and " regular " Republicans were at loggerheads , may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion . Among the variable strategies available to the minority party , which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process , are the following :
An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube , and concluded that while the system was " surprisingly resilient " in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos , it was not infallible . The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases , as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use . If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID , it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision . YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site 's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length .
The major and native language spoken in the Punjab is Punjabi ( which is written in a Shahmukhi script in Pakistan ) and Punjabis comprise the largest ethnic group in country . Punjabi is the provincial language of Punjab . There is not a single district in the province where Punjabi language is mother-tongue of less than 89 % of population . The language is not given any official recognition in the Constitution of Pakistan at the national level . Punjabis themselves are a heterogeneous group comprising different tribes , clans ( Urdu : برادری‎ ) and communities . In Pakistani Punjab these tribes have more to do with traditional occupations such as blacksmiths or artisans as opposed to rigid social stratifications . Punjabi dialects spoken in the province include Majhi ( Standard ) , Saraiki and Hindko . Saraiki is mostly spoken in south Punjab , and Pashto , spoken in some parts of north west Punjab , especially in Attock District and Mianwali District .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
Greece attracts more than 16 million tourists each year , thus contributing 18.2 % to the nation 's GDP in 2008 according to an OECD report . The same survey showed that the average tourist expenditure while in Greece was $ 1,073 , ranking Greece 10th in the world . The number of jobs directly or indirectly related to the tourism sector were 840,000 in 2008 and represented 19 % of the country 's total labor force . In 2009 , Greece welcomed over 19.3 million tourists , a major increase from the 17.7 million tourists the country welcomed in 2008 .
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature . All of the characters in Herman Wouk 's City Boy : The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder ( 1948 ) live in the Bronx , and about half of the action is set there . Kate Simon 's Bronx Primitive : Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical , a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II , and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue . In Jacob M. Appel 's short story , " The Grand Concourse " ( 2007 ) , a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter . Similarly , in Avery Corman 's book The Old Neighborhood ( 1980 ) , an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ( Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse ) , and learns that even though the folks are poor , Hispanic and African-American , they are good people .

In late 1954 , Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to " Free Vietnam " ( the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955 ) , effectively elevating the country to sovereign status . Collins ' instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism , by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign . In February 1955 , Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem 's army . After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , commonly known as South Vietnam ) in October , Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military , economic , and technical assistance .
The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine Gaza . In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area . Its mosaic floor depicts King David as Orpheus , identified by his name in Hebrew letters . Near him were lion cubs , a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre . A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves , each of which contains an animal : a lioness suckling her cub , a giraffe , peacocks , panthers , bears , a zebra and so on . The floor was paved in 508/509 . It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon ( Menois ) and the Christian church at Shellal , suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places .
Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one 's fellow human being . Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong , and that model writers of Latin , such as Cicero and others , used the word only to mean what we might call " humane " or " polite " learning , or the Greek equivalent Paideia . Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance , and , in fifteenth-century Italy , teachers and scholars of philosophy , poetry , and rhetoric were called and called themselves " humanists " . Modern scholars , however , point out that Cicero ( 106 – 43 BCE ) , who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas , in fact frequently used the word in both senses , as did his near contemporaries . For Cicero , a lawyer , what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech , which , allied to reason , could ( and should ) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law . Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative , humanism , which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship .
Politically , Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . He appreciated the advantages of democracy : " It is an invaluable gift , if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God . To further protect the rights of ordinary people , Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . Besides England , the Netherlands were , under Calvinist leadership , the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle . Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible .
Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened , catering Nepali cuisine , Tibetan cuisine , Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular . Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . Continental cuisine can be found in selected places . International chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of Pizza Hut and KFC have recently opened there . It also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain Baskin-Robbins
Prodigies were transgressions in the natural , predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune . The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false , or genuine and in the public interest , in which case it was referred to the public priests , augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation . In 207 BC , during one of the Punic Wars ' worst crises , the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved " at least twenty days " of dedicated rites .
Nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at Milan , Avignon , Liège , Cologne , and elsewhere . Benedict XIV ( De synodo diœces. , l. II , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . In practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx : The Hub , Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard . The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District ( B.I.D . ) , in The Hub , is the retail heart of the South Bronx , located where four roads converge : East 149th Street , Willis , Melrose and Third Avenues . It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven . The Hub has been called " the Broadway of the Bronx " , being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx . It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density . In configuration , it resembles a miniature Times Square , a spatial " bow-tie " created by the geometry of the street . The Hub is part of Bronx Community Board 1 .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
After 1517 , when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available , the Dutch humanist Erasmus , who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of Aldus Manutius , began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla , comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter . Erasmus , along with the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples , began issuing new translations , laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation . Henceforth Renaissance humanism , particularly in the German North , became concerned with religion , while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists , studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith . After the Reformation , critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called Higher criticism of the 19th-century German Tübingen school .
While the new plebeian nobility made social , political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves , their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults . During the Punic crisis , popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy ; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber , the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms , and with Roman Bacchus . Official consternation at these enthusiastic , unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion , and was followed by ferocious suppression . Much later , a statue of Marsyas , the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo , became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus ' censorship . Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo ; but his settlement appealed to all classes . Where loyalty was implicit , no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced ; Liber 's festival continued .
As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible , education on all levels got a strong boost . By the middle of the eighteenth century , the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent , in Scotland 65 per cent , and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write . Colleges and universities were founded . For example , the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later . About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century , including Yale ( 1701 ) . Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning .
There are 48 departments in Punjab government . Each Department is headed by a Provincial Minister ( Politician ) and a Provincial Secretary ( A civil servant of usually BPS-20 or BPS-21 ) . All Ministers report to the Chief Minister , who is the Chief Executive . All Secretaries report to the Chief Secretary of Punjab , who is usually a BPS-22 Civil Servant . The Chief Secretary in turn reports to the Chief Minister . In addition to these departments , there are several Autonomous Bodies and Attached Departments that report directly to either the Secretaries or the Chief Secretary .
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
Bronx native Nancy Savoca 's 1989 comedy , True Love , explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding . The film , which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard as the betrothed couple , won the Grand Jury Prize at that year 's Sundance Film Festival . The CBS television sitcom Becker , 1998–2004 , was more ambiguous . The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker , a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients , co-workers , friends , and practically everything and everybody else in his world . It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx .
Since then , tourism in Nepal has thrived ; it is the country 's most important industry . [ citation needed ] Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city , with several hundred thousand visitors annually . Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu 's religious sites such as Pashupatinath , Swayambhunath , Boudhanath and Budhanilkantha . From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62 , the number jumped to 491,504 in 1999/2000 . Following the end of the Maoist insurgency , there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009 . Since then , tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic . In economic terms , the foreign exchange registered 3.8 % of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining [ why ? ] . The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country .
Although the Reformation was a religious movement , it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life : marriage and family , education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy , and the arts . Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry . Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries . Since about 1950 , women have entered the ministry , and some have assumed leading positions ( e.g . bishops ) , in most Protestant churches .
Greece is classified as an advanced , high-income economy , and was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( BSEC ) . The country joined what is now the European Union in 1981 . In 2001 Greece adopted the euro as its currency , replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachmae per euro . Greece is a member of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Trade Organization , and ranked 34th on Ernst & Young 's Globalization Index 2011 .
In May 1955 , McCarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to White House personnel . Eisenhower was furious , and issued an order as follows : " It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters ... it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications , or any documents or reproductions , concerning such advice be disclosed . " This was an unprecedented step by Eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting , and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege . Ike 's denial of McCarthy 's access to his staff reduced McCarthy 's hearings to rants about trivial matters , and contributed to his ultimate downfall .
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar , but occasioned by events . The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows , though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event . During the late Republic , the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display , and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests . Under the Principate , all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control : the most lavish were subsidised by emperors , and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office . Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries . Others , such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era ( saeculum ) , became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity . That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part .
The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU . Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor . Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013 , the third in Bulgaria , in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in former Yugoslavia and in other Balkan countries .
Eisenhower 's main goals in office were to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits . In the first year of his presidency , he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in an effort to conclude the Korean War ; his New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces . He ordered coups in Iran and Guatemala . Eisenhower refused to give major aid to help France in Vietnam . He gave strong financial support to the new nation of South Vietnam . Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution , which obliged the U.S. to militarily support the pro-Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the isolation of the People 's Republic of China .
In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art , noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede , Santa Maria in Domnica , Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura , Santa Cecilia in Trastevere , Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano . The great dining hall of Pope Leo III in the Lateran Palace was also decorated with mosaics . They were all destroyed later except for one example , the so-called Triclinio Leoniano of which a copy was made in the 18th century . Another great work of Pope Leo , the apse mosaic of Santa Susanna , depicted Christ with the Pope and Charlemagne on one side , and SS . Susanna and Felicity on the other . It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585 . Pope Paschal I ( 817–824 ) embellished the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church ( destroyed in 1607 ) .
Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel . After a few months with no success by the French , he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes . Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet – allied participation and congressional approval . When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954 , Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the Vice President and the head of NCS .
Due to its location , the Punjab region came under constant attacks and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the Greeks , Kushans , Scythians , Turks , and Afghans . The city of Taxila , founded by son of Taksh the son Bharat who was the brother of Ram . It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world , [ citation needed ] Takshashila University . One of the teachers was the great Vedic thinker and politician Chanakya . Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the Maurya Empire . It is a UN World Heritage site , valued for its archaeological and religious history .
On ancient reliefs , especially from Mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana . Taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . Euripides ' tale of Artemis and Actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
The religion 's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . The Watch Tower Society 's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah 's Witnesses within their organization since 1950 , " not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . " William Bowen , a former Jehovah 's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its " crime-free " reputation . In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780,000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing .
Just as artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci – partaking of the zeitgeist though not himself a humanist – advocated study of human anatomy , nature , and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art , so Spanish-born humanist Juan Luis Vives ( c. 1493–1540 ) advocated observation , craft , and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities , helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism . Thus , the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to natural philosophy , based on empirical observations and experimentation of the physical universe , making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance .
Mosaic has a long history , starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC . Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century , by eastern-influenced Venice , and among the Rus in Ukraine . Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance , though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique . Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics .
The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower 's resignation in December 1950 , when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe . Eisenhower retired from active service as an Army general on May 31 , 1952 , and he resumed his presidency of Columbia . He held this position until January 20 , 1953 , when he became the President of the United States .
Metropolitan Kathmandu is divided into five sectors : the Central Sector , the East Sector , the North Sector , the City Core and the West Sector . For civic administration , the city is further divided into 35 administrative wards . The Council administers the Metropolitan area of Kathmandu city through its 177 elected representatives and 20 nominated members . It holds biannual meetings to review , process and approve the annual budget and make major policy decisions . The ward 's profile documents for the 35 wards prepared by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Council is detailed and provides information for each ward on population , the structure and condition of houses , the type of roads , educational , health and financial institutions , entertainment facilities , parking space , security provisions , etc . It also includes lists of development projects completed , on-going and planned , along with informative data about the cultural heritage , festivals , historical sites and the local inhabitants . Ward 16 is the largest , with an area of 437.4 ha ; ward 26 is the smallest , with an area of 4 ha .
The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends . According to Swayambhu Purana , present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake names " Nagdaha " as it was full of snakes . The lake was cut drained by Bodhisatwa Manjusri with his sword and the water was evacuated out from there and he established a city called Manjupattan and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land . After sometimes , a demon named Banasur closed the outlet and the valley was again a lake . Then lots Krishna came to Nepal , killed Banasur and again drained out water . He has brought some Gops with him and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only-begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( Apollyon ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2:5 ) is applied to the 'anointed ' class , though the 'other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement .
A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos . In January 2009 , YouTube launched " YouTube for TV " , a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers , initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles . In June 2009 , YouTube XL was introduced , which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen . YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live . On November 15 , 2012 , Google launched an official app for the Wii , allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel . An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5 . Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17 , 2013 and in October 2014 , the Sony PlayStation 4 .
The Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet , stating that its teachings are not inspired or infallible , and that it has not claimed its predictions were " the words of Jehovah . " George D. Chryssides has suggested that with the exception of statements about 1914 , 1925 and 1975 , the changing views and dates of the Jehovah 's Witnesses are largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions . Chryssides further states , " it is therefore simplistic and naïve to view the Witnesses as a group that continues to set a single end-date that fails and then devise a new one , as many counter-cultists do . " However , sociologist Andrew Holden states that since the foundation of the movement around 140 years ago , " Witnesses have maintained that we are living on the precipice of the end of time . "
Both private individuals and large production companies have used YouTube to grow audiences . Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort , while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic . Concurrently , old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings , and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television . While YouTube 's revenue-sharing " Partner Program " made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $ 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $ 2.5 million to $ 12 million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as " a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels " . In 2013 Forbes ' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists ' work must not only be of high quality , but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media . In 2013 , videos of the 2.5 % of artists categorized as " mega " , " mainstream " and " mid-sized " received 90.3 % of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo . By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts .
The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God ’ s creation ; some elements also have specific connotations . The kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist , the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation . Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection ; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life . Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ : " As a heart desireth the water brook , so my souls longs for thee , O God . " Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened .
During the Cretaceous , the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . As the Atlantic Ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera , as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies . Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous , Gondwana itself broke up as South America , Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa ( though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed . Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
The style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements , including personality and contextual factors , such as the size and cohesion of the minority party , whether his or her party controls the White House , the general political climate in the House , and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda . Despite the variability of these factors , there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position . Many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the House rule book . Others have devolved upon the position in other ways . To be sure , the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources—beyond those accorded him or her as a Representative—to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions . Worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader , because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda , partisan ratios on committees , staff resources , administrative operations , and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities .
In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate . Once in office , when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary , he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded . His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese . The National Security Council , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China . With the death of Stalin in early March 1953 , Russian support for a Chinese hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
The Martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished . The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina , with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . The Greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina . The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily , dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia , the founder of the church .
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
In 1954 , Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America . He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India . Likewise , the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico . That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community ( EDC ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " Long faces do n't win wars " . As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC , he afterwards moved to restore West Germany , as a full NATO partner .
The Third Great Awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . It was affiliated with the Social Gospel Movement , which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . New groupings emerged , such as the Holiness , Nazarene , and Christian Science movements .
In China , Yellow Emperor is regarded as the humanistic primogenitor . [ citation needed ] Sage kings such as Yao and Shun are humanistic figures as recorded . [ citation needed ] King Wu of Zhou has the famous saying : " Humanity is the Ling ( efficacious essence ) of the world ( among all ) . " Among them Duke of Zhou , respected as a founder of Rujia ( Confucianism ) , is especially prominent and pioneering in humanistic thought . His words were recorded in the Book of History as follows ( translation ) : [ citation needed ]
Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe , although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals . The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár ( Alba Regia ) had a mosaic decoration in the apse . It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen , executed in the first decades of the 11th century . The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century . The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal . It was executed by Venetian craftsmen .
In 885 AD the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty . A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045 , and the subsequent invasion of the region by Seljuk Turks in 1064 . They settled in large numbers in Cilicia , an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times . In 1080 , they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia , which became the focus of Armenian nationalism . The Armenians developed close social , cultural , military , and religious ties with nearby Crusader States , but eventually succumbed to Mamluk invasions . In the next few centuries , Djenghis Khan , Timurids , and the tribal Turkic federations of the Ak Koyunlu and the Kara Koyunlu ruled over the Armenians .
Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms . Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs . When present , however , these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body . A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone . The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived , non-lethal infection . Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus . Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus , Allosaurus , Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation . The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
In the 6th century BCE , Taoist teacher Lao Tzu espoused a series of naturalistic concepts with some elements of humanistic philosophy . The Silver Rule of Confucianism from Analects XV.24 , is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural . Humanistic thought is also contained in other Confucian classics , e.g. , as recorded in Zuo Zhuan , Ji Liang says , " People is the zhu ( master , lord , dominance , owner or origin ) of gods . So , to sage kings , people first , gods second " ; Neishi Guo says , " Gods , clever , righteous and wholehearted , comply with human . " Taoist and Confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism .
Sociologist James A. Beckford , in his 1975 study of Jehovah 's Witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as Totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . Beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that Jehovah 's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in elections for Mayor . The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La Guardia in 1933 , 1937 and 1941 ( and in the latter two elections , only because his 30-32 % vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22-23 % as a Republican ) . The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors Rudolph Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 . The anti-war Socialist campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31 % of the Bronx 's vote , putting him second and well ahead of the 20 % won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel , who came in second ( ahead of Hillquit ) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2 % to 21.7 % .
Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube 's running costs , and YouTube 's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing . In June 2008 , a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $ 200 million , noting progress in advertising sales . In January 2012 , it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site , in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television . In 2012 , YouTube 's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion . In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer , others estimated 4.7 billion ,
A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g . to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the University of Toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
Between 1949 and the 1980s , telephone communications in Greece were a state monopoly by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization , better known by its acronym , OTE . Despite the liberalization of telephone communications in the country in the 1980s , OTE still dominates the Greek market in its field and has emerged as one of the largest telecommunications companies in Southeast Europe . Since 2011 , the company 's major shareholder is Deutsche Telekom with a 40 % stake , while the Greek state continues to own 10 % of the company 's shares . OTE owns several subsidiaries across the Balkans , including Cosmote , Greece 's top mobile telecommunications provider , Cosmote Romania and Albanian Mobile Communications .
Swayambhu is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city . This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal . Although the site is considered Buddhist , it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus . The stupa consists of a dome at the base ; above the dome , there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions . [ clarification needed ] There are pentagonal Toran above each of the four sides , with statues engraved on them . Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers . Above all the tiers , there is a small space above which lies a gajur .
Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . In a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium . Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water . A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn " . The size , color , shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species , its specific genetic makeup ( its strain ) , and the environment that supports its growth . Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification . Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others , or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others . Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium . Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses : the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect , and then alter or kill . In the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque " . Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent .
The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768 . This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu . The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley . Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire , and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal . During the early part of this era , Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture . Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture , such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur , were built during this era . However , trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations . Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain ; this led to the development of modern military structures , such as modern barracks in Kathmandu . The nine-storey tower Dharahara was originally built during this era .
In Europe , there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism . The Enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secularism . Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism , attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant countries . In North America , South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe . United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries . South America , historically Roman Catholic , has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries .
There are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches , and are far smaller in membership . Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as " Christians " or " born-again Christians " . They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communities by calling themselves " non-denominational " or " evangelical " . Often founded by individual pastors , they have little affiliation with historic denominations .
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .
Armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . Arguably the favorite food is khorovats an Armenian-styled barbecue . Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread , and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . Also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture . Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet . Apricots ( Prunus armeniaca , also known as Armenian Plum ) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . Peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . Preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches , having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon . Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion , not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion . During its later political eclipses , Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin . However , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of Armenia , made the political power move to safer places . The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . Therefore , it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
In the Presidential primary elections of February 5 , 2008 , Sen. Clinton won 61.2 % of the Bronx 's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8 % for Barack Obama and 1.0 % for the other four candidates combined ( John Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , Bill Richardson and Joe Biden ) . On the same day , John McCain won 54.4 % of the borough 's 5,643 Republican votes , Mitt Romney 20.8 % , Mike Huckabee 8.2 % , Ron Paul 7.4 % , Rudy Giuliani 5.6 % , and the other candidates ( Fred Thompson , Duncan Hunter and Alan Keyes ) 3.6 % between them .
Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to Sigmund Freud 's psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner 's Behaviorism . The approach emphasizes an individual 's inherent drive towards self-actualization and creativity . Psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow introduced a positive , humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s . Other sources include the philosophies of existentialism and phenomenology .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that God 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 " spirit-anointed " Christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with Jesus ' reference to a " new covenant " . The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus ' ministry on earth . They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
Over the years the city has been home to people of various ethnicities , resulting in a range of different traditions and cultural practices . In one decade , the population increased from 427,045 in 1991 to 671,805 in 2001 . The population was projected to reach 915,071 in 2011 and 1,319,597 by 2021 . To keep up this population growth , the KMC-controlled area of 5,076.6 hectares ( 12,545 acres ) has expanded to 8,214 hectares ( 20,300 acres ) in 2001 . With this new area , the population density which was 85 in 1991 is still 85 in 2001 ; it is likely to jump to 111 in 2011 and 161 in 2021 .
Critics of the modern concept of the " separation of church and state " argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it . Philip Hamburger , Columbia Law school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept , maintains that the modern concept , which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence , is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and Nativism . [ citation needed ] Briefs before the Supreme Court , including by the U.S. government , have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state ( Blaine Amendments ) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls , which are typically functional in character , and do not contain religious symbols . Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose " territory " they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as " meetings " as scheduled by congregation elders . The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible . The format of the meetings is established by the religion 's headquarters , and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide . Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours , typically gathering mid-week ( three meetings ) and on the weekend ( two meetings ) . Prior to 2009 , congregations met three times each week ; these meetings were condensed , with the intention that members dedicate an evening for " family worship " . Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs ( hymns ) and brief prayers . Twice each year , Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a " circuit " gather for a one-day assembly . Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day " regional convention " , usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums . Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the " Lord 's Evening Meal " , or " Memorial of Christ 's Death " on the date of the Jewish Passover .
The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society . In the middle Republican era , even Scipio 's tentative hints that he might be Jupiter 's special protege sat ill with his colleagues . Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal ; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus . Julius Caesar went further , and claimed her as his ancestress . Such claims suggested personal character and policy as divinely inspired ; an appointment to priesthood offered divine validation . In 63 BC , Julius Caesar 's appointment as pontifex maximus " signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics " . Likewise , political candidates could sponsor temples , priesthoods and the immensely popular , spectacular public ludi and munera whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic . Under the principate , such opportunities were limited by law ; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps ( " first citizen " ) .
The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome 's intellectual elite , but the more obscure they were , the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform , which often cloaked autocratic innovation , nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era , Ovid . In his Fasti , a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June , Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore , popular customs , and religious practice that is by turns imaginative , entertaining , high-minded , and scurrilous ; not a priestly account , despite the speaker 's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet , but a work of description , imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia , Consualia , and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March , where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people . But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events , indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances . In the later Empire under Christian rule , the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar , alongside at least some of the traditional festivals .
Each year , nearly $ 200 million in hunters ' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs , the purchase of lands open to hunters , and hunter education and safety classes . Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps , a required purchase for migratory waterfowl hunters over sixteen years old , has raised over $ 700 million to help purchase more than 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting . States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals , as designated by law . A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting , including species protection , hunting seasons , and hunting bans .
Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas , son of Venus , who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium , Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy . These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals , Rome 's female priesthood . Aeneas had been given refuge by King Evander , a Greek exile from Arcadia , to whom were attributed other religious foundations : he established the Ara Maxima , " Greatest Altar , " to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium , and he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia , an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era .
In recent years a number of well-known tourism-related organizations have placed Greek destinations in the top of their lists . In 2009 Lonely Planet ranked Thessaloniki , the country 's second-largest city , the world 's fifth best " Ultimate Party Town " , alongside cities such as Montreal and Dubai , while in 2011 the island of Santorini was voted as the best island in the world by Travel + Leisure . The neighbouring island of Mykonos was ranked as the 5th best island Europe . Thessaloniki was the European Youth Capital in 2014 .
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state , allowing a variety of religions to flourish . Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a " remarkable religiosity " in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on " a sort of civic religion , " which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who " expects better of us . " Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience . He calls this approach the " genius of religious sentiment in the United States . "
The northwestern part of the South Asia , including Punjab , was repeatedly invaded or conquered by various foreign empires , such as those of Tamerlane , Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan . Having conquered Drangiana , Arachosia , Gedrosia and Seistan in ten days , Alexander crossed the Hindu Kush and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold , gems and pearls . However , Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains . Having taken a northeasterly direction , he marched against the Aspii ( mountaineers ) , who offered vigorous resistance , but were subdued . [ citation needed ] Alexander then marched through Ghazni , blockaded Magassa , and then marched to Ora and Bazira . Turning to the northeast , Alexander marched to Pucela , the capital of the district now known as Pakhli . He entered Western Punjab , where the ancient city of Nysa ( at the site of modern-day Mong ) was situated . A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians , the people of Multan , who were very skilful in war . Alexander invested many troops , eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle , and the city of Sagala ( present-day Sialkot ) was razed to the ground . Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C . and took his army to the heartlands of his empire . [ citation needed ]
Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs , worship practices and church structures . The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana , a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church . There is no single " Anglican Church " with universal juridical authority , since each national or regional church has full autonomy . As the name suggests , the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury . The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion , which has 80 million adherents .
The 1960 Four Power Paris Summit between President Dwight Eisenhower , Nikita Khrushchev , Harold Macmillan and Charles de Gaulle collapsed because of the incident . Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev 's demands that he apologize . Therefore , Khrushchev would not take part in the summit . Up until this event , Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union . Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit . Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that " stupid U-2 business " .
Each of Rome 's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic . Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests . The first " outsider " Etruscan king , Lucius Tarquinius Priscus , founded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter , Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world . The benevolent , divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin League , its Aventine Temple to Diana , and the Compitalia to mark his social reforms . Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbus , whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected magistrates .
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . [ citation needed ] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Middle East . Actors from all over the Arab World seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
Perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of transnational policing is : in whose interest is it ? At a more practical level , the question translates into one about how to make transnational policing institutions democratically accountable ( Sheptycki , 2004 ) . For example , according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007 ( Lloyd , et al . 2007 ) Interpol had the lowest scores in its category ( IGOs ) , coming in tenth with a score of 22 % on overall accountability capabilities ( p. 19 ) . As this report points out , and the existing academic literature on transnational policing seems to confirm , this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement .
The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome 's internal governance , diplomacy and development from kingdom , to Republic and to Empire . Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite : kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices . In the early Republic , as presumably in the regal era , plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office , and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge . They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office , public priesthood , and knowledge of civil and religious law . The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency ; he negotiated a settlement , and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia . The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public . Plebeian tribunes were appointed , with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate . In principle , the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians . In reality , the patrician and to a lesser extent , plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond .
Beginning with the advent of beat match DJing , in which Bronx DJs ( Disc Jockeys ) including Grandmaster Flash , Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Kool Herc extended the breaks of funk records , a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk , disco and soul songs . As hip hop 's popularity grew , performers began speaking ( " rapping " ) in sync with the beats , and became known as MCs or emcees . The Herculoids , made up of Herc , Coke La Rock , and DJ Clark Kent , were the earliest to gain major fame . The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as " The Boogie Down Bronx " , or just " The Boogie Down " . This was hip-hop pioneer KRS-One 's inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP , or Boogie Down Productions , which included DJ Scott La Rock . Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include Big Pun , Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz , Camp Lo , Swizz Beatz , Drag-On , Fat Joe , Terror Squad and Corey Gunz .
The fire service , known as the Barun Yantra Karyalaya , opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle . An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for fire . As a precautionary measure , firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas . In 1944 , the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur . In 1966 , a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport . In 1975 , a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu 's fire service . The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization , the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal ( FAN ) , which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety .
The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages . In 1873 , the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge , West Farms and Morrisania to New York , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . In 1895 , three years before New York 's consolidation with Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island , the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River , including the Town of Westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham , were annexed to the city . City Island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances . The purposes of obstruction are several , such as frustrating the majority party 's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party . " We know how to delay , " remarked Minority Leader Gephardt Dilatory motions to adjourn , appeals of the presiding officer 's ruling , or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics . By stalling action on the majority party 's agenda , the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a " do-nothing Congress " and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House . To be sure , the minority leader recognizes that " going negative " carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public .
The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising Hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the Muslim Umayyad army led by Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712 , by defeating Raja Dahir . The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad . It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty , whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams , the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph . Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of Mecca , their capital was Damascus . Muhammad bin Qasim was the first to bring message of Islam to the population of Punjab . [ citation needed ] Punjab was part of different Muslim Empires consisting of Afghans and Turkic peoples in co-operation with local Punjabi tribes and others . [ citation needed ] In the 11th century , during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni , the province became an important centre with Lahore as its second capital [ citation needed ] of the Ghaznavid Empire based out of Afghanistan . The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region .
They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message .
With the building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century , wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses . The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived , but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana , both from the 4th century , still exist . The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus , which symbolizes transformation or change , and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum , the original function of this building . In another great Constantinian basilica , the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved . The so-called Tomb of the Julii , near the crypt beneath St Peter 's Basilica , is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations . The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki , converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century , was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics . Only fragments survive of the original decoration , especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer , in front of complex architectural fantasies .
Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the pax deorum with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was ( in traditional Roman terms ) auspicious - or in Christian terms , what was orthodox . The edict of Milan ( 313 ) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration . Constantine had triumphed under the signum ( sign ) of the Christ : Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital , Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests . He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the genius of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian 's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch . His later direct intervention in Church affairs proved a political masterstroke . Constantine united the empire as an absolute head of state , and on his death , he was honored as a Christian , Imperial , and " divus " .

Various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada . Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization , more than 4000 years ago . The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa . The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation . The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River . This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan . Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast , an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found . Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas , Achaemenids , Macedonians , Mauryas , Kushans , Guptas , and Hindu Shahi . It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time , otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire . Agriculture flourished and trading cities ( such as Multan and Lahore ) grew in wealth .
Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body . The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " God 's organization " . It also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by Satan the Devil " and would " cause division " . Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " .
In Rome , Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea , built 64 AD , and wall mosaics are also found at Pompeii and neighbouring sites . However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression . The Roman church of Santa Costanza , which served as a mausoleum for one or more of the Imperial family , has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault , which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration .
The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . In times of great crisis , the Senate could decree collective public rites , in which Rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
As of June 2012 [ update ] , Pakistan 's electricity problems were so severe that violent riots were taking place across Punjab . According to protesters , load shedding was depriving the cities of electricity 20–22 hours a day , causing businesses to go bust and making living extremely hard . Gujranwala , Toba Tek Singh , Faisalabad , Sialkot , Bahawalnagar and communities across Khanewal District saw widespread rioting and violence on Sunday 17 June 2012 , with the houses of several members of parliament being attacked as well as the offices of regional energy suppliers Fesco , Gepco and Mepco being ransacked or attacked .
Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War , Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ver sacrum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies . The " contract " with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed . All due care would be taken of the animals . If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . Normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be withheld . In the imperial period , sacrifice was withheld following Trajan 's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period . In Pompeii , the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
It gained great momentum in the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America . The origins of Evangelicalism are usually traced back to the English Methodist movement , Nicolaus Zinzendorf , the Moravian Church , Lutheran pietism , Presbyterianism and Puritanism . Among leaders and major figures of the Evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Harold John Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones .
Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in Moorish Spain . The golden mosaics in the mihrab and the central dome of the Great Mosque in Corduba have a decidedly Byzantine character . They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen , supervised by a master mosaicist from Constantinople , who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain . The decoration is composed of colorful floral arabesques and wide bands of Arab calligraphy . The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus , which was lost for the Umayyad family .

Protestantism has had an important influence on science . According to the Merton Thesis , there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other . The Merton Thesis has two separate parts : Firstly , it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly , it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society ( English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values . Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries . He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science . Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God 's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research .
On November 6 , 2013 , Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented . The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments . They give creators more power to moderate and block comments , and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better , more relevant discussions appear at the top . The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments , which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse . In response , YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question " why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video ? " on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change . The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 " thumbs down " votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days . Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island , Chase Melvin noted that " Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook , but it 's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who do n't want to lose their ability to comment on videos " and " Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system " . In the same article Melvin goes on to say :
Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely , particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in France and Germany . They included nonconformists like the Puritans , who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England . Despite a common background , the groups ' views on religious toleration were mixed . While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies , others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches . The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship , though enforcement was sparse . Religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons : the established Church was responsible for poverty relief , putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage .
The province is home to several historical sites , including the Shalimar Gardens , the Lahore Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Rohtas Fort and the ruins of the ancient city of Harrapa . The Anarkali Market and Jahangir 's Tomb are prominent in the city of Lahore as is the Lahore Museum , while the ancient city of Taxila in the northwest was once a major centre of Buddhist and Hindu influence . Several important Sikh shrines are in the province , including the birthplace of the first Guru , Guru Nanak . ( born at Nankana Sahib ) . There are a few famous hill stations , including Murree , Bhurban , Patriata and Fort Munro .
The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768 . This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu . The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley . Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire , and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal . During the early part of this era , Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture . Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture , such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur , were built during this era . However , trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations . Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain ; this led to the development of modern military structures , such as modern barracks in Kathmandu . The nine-storey tower Dharahara was originally built during this era .
Edgar took the first turn at school , and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery . Edgar asked for a second year , Dwight consented and worked for a second year . At that time , a friend " Swede " Hazlet was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school , since no tuition was required . Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S . Senator , Joseph L. Bristow . Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition , he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy . He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911 .
The rediscovery of Aristotle 's works–more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated –fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century . Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history . Richard Dales , for instance , calls the discovery of Aristotle 's works " a turning point in the history of Western thought . " After Aristotle re-emerged , a community of scholars , primarily communicating in Latin , accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity , and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world , with those of the church . The efforts of this " scholasticism " were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason . This became the primary mission of lecturers , and the expectation of students .
Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax-free status of church property , the fact that Christmas is a federal holiday , etc. , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . The national motto " In God We Trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the Supreme Court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature . A circuit court ruling affirmed Ohio 's right to use as its motto a passage from the Bible , " With God , all things are possible " , because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
After the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite in 1957 , Eisenhower authorized the establishment of NASA , which led to the space race . During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , Eisenhower condemned the Israeli , British and French invasion of Egypt , and forced them to withdraw . He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action . In 1958 , Eisenhower sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-inspired revolution . Near the end of his term , his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident . In his January 17 , 1961 farewell address to the nation , Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending , particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers , and coined the term " military–industrial complex " .
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer , so it is difficult to make generalizations , but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature ( Alain , 2001 ) . Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) . James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies ' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic . He argues that transnational police information circuits help to " compose the panic scenes of the security-control society " . The paradoxical effect is that , the harder policing agencies work to produce security , the greater are feelings of insecurity .
For the popular taste however , light music , particularly Ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of Mehdi Hassan , Ghulam Ali , Nur Jehan , Malika Pukhraj , Farida Khanum , Roshen Ara Begum , and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan are well-known . Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . Luddi , Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living . Love legends of Heer Ranjha , Mirza Sahiban , Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles .
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists , and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks , and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side . According to the Nepali Hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation . The chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .

The original Latin word " universitas " refers in general to " a number of persons associated into one body , a society , company , community , guild , corporation , etc . " At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds , specialised " associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes , prelates , or the towns in which they were located " came to be denominated by this general term . Like other guilds , they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members .
Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . The most important is the so-called " Armenian Mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate . It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . Populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . The inscription reads : " For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows . " Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube 's running costs , and YouTube 's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing . In June 2008 , a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $ 200 million , noting progress in advertising sales . In January 2012 , it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site , in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television . In 2012 , YouTube 's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion . In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer , others estimated 4.7 billion ,
At the time , there were many varying opinions about Christian doctrine , and no centralized way of enforcing orthodoxy . Constantine called all the Christian bishops throughout the Roman Empire to a meeting , and some 318 bishops ( very few from the Western Empire ) attended the First Council of Nicaea . The purpose of this meeting was to define Christian orthodoxy and clearly differentiate it from Christian heresies . The meeting reached consensus on the Nicene Creed and other statements . Later , Philostorgius criticized Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus Constantine . Constantine nevertheless took great pains to assuage traditionalist and Christian anxieties .
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied , and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy . The traditional care of the dead , however , and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion . Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased , an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods . As Roman society developed , its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead , and more on monumental endowments to the community , such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name . Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial , with such grave goods as relatives could afford .
In 2014 , the airport received 15 new boarding bridges , totalling 28 in all . This was the main requirement made by the federal government , which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction . The group invested R $ 750 million in the project . In the same year , the number of parking spaces doubled , reaching three thousand . The airport 's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road . Furthermore , a VIP room was created on Terminal 1 's third floor . The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília 's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014 . Brasília has direct flights to all states of Brazil and direct international flights to Atlanta , Buenos Aires , Lisbon , Miami , Panama City , and Paris .
One way of proving that a given disease is " infectious " , is to satisfy Koch 's postulates ( first proposed by Robert Koch ) , which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls , and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease . These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis . Koch 's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture . Often , even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria . For example , Treponema pallidum , the causative spirochete of syphilis , can not be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes . It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture . Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population . For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic ( occasional occurrence ) , endemic ( regular cases often occurring in a region ) , epidemic ( an unusually high number of cases in a region ) , or pandemic ( a global epidemic ) .
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet . [ note 5 ] Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " .
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . [ citation needed ] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Middle East . Actors from all over the Arab World seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479 , Ferdinand and Isabella established the centrally organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood ( Santa Hermandad ) as a national police force . They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves , and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases . The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835 .
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius , the doomed son of Pompey the Great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . Erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions " . She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . A female foreigner from Thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature , along with Horace 's Canidia .
The clearance of the pathogens , either treatment-induced or spontaneous , it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients . For instance , for genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b ( brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron ) combined with ribavirin , it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene , encoding interferon lambda 3 , are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus . This finding , originally reported in Nature , showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others . Later report from Nature demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus .
Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth , status and religious context . In Cicero 's time , the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation . The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre , Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar , and the family at the site of the cremation . For the less well-off , inhumation with " a libation of wine , incense , and fruit or crops was sufficient " . Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead : the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living . The ashes ( or body ) were entombed or buried . On the eighth day of mourning , the family offered further sacrifice , this time on the ground ; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld . They had become one of the di Manes , who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia , a multi-day festival of remembrance in February .
Imported mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practiced in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . The mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of " magic " , conspiratorial ( coniuratio ) , or subversive activity . Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity , as with the senate 's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC .
Politically , Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy . He appreciated the advantages of democracy : " It is an invaluable gift , if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords . " Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God . To further protect the rights of ordinary people , Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy . Besides England , the Netherlands were , under Calvinist leadership , the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle . Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible .
World War II ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country 's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle . From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average , peaking at 5.8 % in 2003 and 5.7 % in 2006 . The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider European debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real GDP growth rates of −0.3 % in 2008 , −4.3 % in 2009 , −5.5 % in 2010 , −9.1 % in 2011 , −7.3 % in 2012 and −3.2 % in 2013 . In 2011 , the country 's public debt reached €356 billion ( 172 % of nominal GDP ) . After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector , Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion ( 137 % of GDP ) in the first quarter of 2012 . Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7 % in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline , but fell back into recession in 2015 .
The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community . Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta 's flame . The Vestals cared for the Lares and Penates of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home . Besides their own festival of Vestalia , they participated directly in the rites of Parilia , Parentalia and Fordicidia . Indirectly , they played a role in every official sacrifice ; among their duties was the preparation of the mola salsa , the salted flour that was sprinkled on every sacrificial victim as part of its immolation .
Thus , the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available . The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application , neither of which is insurmountable . The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods , such as some of the clostridial diseases ( tetanus and botulism ) . These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent neurotoxins . A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur , this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church ’ s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
Towards the end of the Republic , religious and political offices became more closely intertwined ; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative . Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political , military and priestly powers ; at first temporarily , then for his lifetime . He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome 's major priesthoods , including that of pontifex maximus ; as he invented none , he could claim them as traditional honours . His reforms were represented as adaptive , restorative and regulatory , rather than innovative ; most notably his elevation ( and membership ) of the ancient Arvales , his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality . Augustus obtained the pax deorum , maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation . This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors .
One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness . The human strains of Ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . As a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . Also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye . Thus , the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging . As a result of the above features , the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . In contrast , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . As a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . Also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .
The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . For example , humans can make neither RNA replicases nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
The " religious test " clause has been interpreted to cover both elected officials and appointed ones , career civil servants as well as political appointees . Religious beliefs or the lack of them have therefore not been permissible tests or qualifications with regard to federal employees since the ratification of the Constitution . Seven states , however , have language included in their Bill of Rights , Declaration of Rights , or in the body of their constitutions that require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs , though some of these have been successfully challenged in court . These states are Texas , Massachusetts , Maryland , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Tennessee .
The last three years of Eisenhower 's second term in office were ones of relatively good health . Eventually after leaving the White House , he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks . A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs . In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis , for which he underwent surgery on December 12 , 1966 , when his gallbladder was removed , containing 16 gallstones . After Eisenhower 's death in 1969 ( see below ) , an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma , a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease . Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
The Second Great Awakening began around 1790 . It gained momentum by 1800 . After 1820 , membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . It was past its peak by the late 1840s . It has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .
YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno , California , United States . The service was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005 . In November 2006 , it was bought by Google for US $ 1.65 billion . YouTube now operates as one of Google 's subsidiaries . The site allows users to upload , view , rate , share , and comment on videos , and it makes use of WebM , H.264/MPEG-4 AVC , and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video . Available content includes video clips , TV clips , music videos , movie trailers , and other content such as video blogging , short original videos , and educational videos .
The first and last Roman known as a living divus was Julius Caesar , who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy ; he was murdered soon after . Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors , and offered similar cult to Caesar 's successor , Augustus , who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship ; it might prove fatal . By the end of his reign , Augustus had appropriated Rome 's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his " reformed " and thoroughly integrated system of government . Towards the end of his life , he cautiously allowed cult to his numen . By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed , first in the Eastern Provinces , then in the West . Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context ; bathhouses , shrines and temples to Roman and local deities , amphitheatres and festivals . In the early Imperial period , the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship .
Since 1934 , the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission ( MBCC ) .
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
Over the years the city has been home to people of various ethnicities , resulting in a range of different traditions and cultural practices . In one decade , the population increased from 427,045 in 1991 to 671,805 in 2001 . The population was projected to reach 915,071 in 2011 and 1,319,597 by 2021 . To keep up this population growth , the KMC-controlled area of 5,076.6 hectares ( 12,545 acres ) has expanded to 8,214 hectares ( 20,300 acres ) in 2001 . With this new area , the population density which was 85 in 1991 is still 85 in 2001 ; it is likely to jump to 111 in 2011 and 161 in 2021 .
Between 1832 and 2002 the currency of Greece was the drachma . After signing the Maastricht Treaty , Greece applied to join the eurozone . The two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3 % of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60 % of GDP . Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account . On 1 January 2001 , Greece joined the eurozone , with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1 . However , in 2001 the euro only existed electronically , so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002 . This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro , which ended on 1 March 2012 .
On the whole , Eisenhower 's support of the nation 's fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 , gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world . He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . His Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created NASA as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and fostered improved relations with American scientists .
