The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market , in the West Bronx , is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space , built on a 17 acres ( 7 ha ) site that formerly held the Bronx Terminal Market , a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention , south of Yankee Stadium . The $ 500 million shopping center , which was completed in 2009 , saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings , one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market . The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars . The center has earned itself a LEED " Silver " designation in its design .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their religion is a restoration of first-century Christianity . Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body , which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture . The Governing Body does not issue any single , comprehensive " statement of faith " , but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the Watch Tower Society . Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation , in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose , and that such enlightenment or " new light " results from the application of reason and study , the guidance of the holy spirit , and direction from Jesus Christ and angels . The Society also teaches that members of the Governing Body are helped by the holy spirit to discern " deep truths " , which are then considered by the entire Governing Body before it makes doctrinal decisions . The religion 's leadership , while disclaiming divine inspiration and infallibility , is said to provide " divine guidance " through its teachings described as " based on God 's Word thus ... not from men , but from Jehovah . "
All police officers in the United Kingdom , whatever their actual rank , are 'constables ' in terms of their legal position . This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner . However , certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations , such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect 's house ( section 18 PACE in England and Wales ) by an officer of the rank of Inspector , or the power to authorize a suspect 's detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent .
A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos . In January 2009 , YouTube launched " YouTube for TV " , a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers , initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles . In June 2009 , YouTube XL was introduced , which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen . YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live . On November 15 , 2012 , Google launched an official app for the Wii , allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel . An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5 . Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17 , 2013 and in October 2014 , the Sony PlayStation 4 .
The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long , stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician . The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years . The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived . As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole , ice caps formed on it . Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America , which were south-polar locations at the time .
Conversely , YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens , the White House 's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson 's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) -compliant health insurance . In February 2014 , U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the " YouTube Generation " . Whereas YouTube 's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted , the YouTube content creators ' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website 's distracting content and fickle audience .
Exhibitions and annual horse shows in all districts and a national horse and cattle show at Lahore are held with the official patronage . The national horse and cattle show at Lahore is the biggest festival where sports , exhibitions , and livestock competitions are held . It not only encourages and patronises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots .
YouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website . Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web . This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs . Users wishing to post a video discussing , inspired by or related to another user 's video are able to make a " video response " . On August 27 , 2013 , YouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature . Embedding , rating , commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church ’ s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius , the doomed son of Pompey the Great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . Erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions " . She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . A female foreigner from Thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature , along with Horace 's Canidia .
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied , and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy . The traditional care of the dead , however , and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion . Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased , an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods . As Roman society developed , its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead , and more on monumental endowments to the community , such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name . Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial , with such grave goods as relatives could afford .
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus , then capital of the Arab Caliphate . The mosque was built between 706 and 715 . The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building . This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration . The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees , flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background . The mosaics include no human figures , which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works . The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard , called the " Barada Panel " after the river Barada . It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world , at over 4 m2 . In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively , and many mosaics were lost , although some have been restored since .
The official published membership statistics , such as those mentioned above , include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry ; official statistics do not include inactive and disfellowshipped individuals or others who might attend their meetings . As a result , only about half of those who self-identified as Jehovah 's Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered active by the faith itself . The 2008 US Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey found a low retention rate among members of the religion : about 37 % of people raised in the religion continued to identify themselves as Jehovah 's Witnesses .
The peninsular borough 's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system 's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. B. J. Snyder . The state 's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler ( on the southeastern shore ) houses the Maritime Industry Museum . In addition , the Harlem River is reemerging as " Scullers ' Row " due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project , a joint public-private endeavor of the city 's parks department . Canoeing and kayaking on the borough 's namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance . The river is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens , its neighbor , the Bronx Zoo , and a little further south , on the west shore , Bronx River Art Center .
The colophons of ancient manuscripts , dated as late as the 20th century , refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala . Mahanagar means " great city " . The city is called " Kasthamandap " in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day . Thus , Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap . During medieval times , the city was sometimes called Kantipur ( कान्तिपुर ) . This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur . " Kanti " is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi , and " pur " means place .
The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters , many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa . The Pregones Theater , which produces Latin American work , opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx . Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area , and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002 . However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area .
The fairs held at the shrines of Sufi saints are called urs . They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint . On these occasions devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint . Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy . The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing . It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages . The most important urs are : urs of Data Ganj Buksh at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Sultan Bahu at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Shah Jewna at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Mian Mir at Lahore , urs of Baba Farid Ganj Shakar at Pakpattan , urs of Hazrat Bahaudin Zakria at Multan , urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at Dera Ghazi Khan , urs of Shah Hussain at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Bulleh Shah at Kasur , urs of Hazrat Imam Bari ( Bari Shah Latif ) at Rawalpindi-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayar Qadri ( the murrshad of Bulleh Shah ) in Lahore .
Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . An example is the Academy of European Law , which offers training in European law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . EUCLID ( Pôle Universitaire Euclide , Euclid University ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the United Nations University engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations , its peoples and member states . The European University Institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the European Union .
The Latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself , but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury : " The architecture of the ancient Romans was , from first to last , an art of shaping space around ritual . " The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct , and the more common Latin words aedes , delubrum , or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building . The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture .
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
Divorce is discouraged , and remarriage is forbidden unless a divorce is obtained on the grounds of adultery , which they refer to as " a scriptural divorce " . If a divorce is obtained for any other reason , remarriage is considered adulterous unless the prior spouse has died or is since considered to have committed sexual immorality . Extreme physical abuse , willful non-support of one 's family , and what the religion terms " absolute endangerment of spirituality " are considered grounds for legal separation .
The D-Day Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 , were costly but successful . A month later , the invasion of Southern France took place , and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF . Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer 's end—however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year . From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8 , 1945 , Eisenhower , through SHAEF , commanded all Allied forces , and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps . He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families . This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion . Eisenhower 's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed . It has been called one of the great speeches of history :
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Imported mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practiced in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . The mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of " magic " , conspiratorial ( coniuratio ) , or subversive activity . Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity , as with the senate 's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC .
Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs , worship practices and church structures . The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana , a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church . There is no single " Anglican Church " with universal juridical authority , since each national or regional church has full autonomy . As the name suggests , the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury . The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion , which has 80 million adherents .
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington , where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany . He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division ( WPD ) , General Leonard T. Gerow , and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division . Next , he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division ( which replaced WPD ) under Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall , who spotted talent and promoted accordingly .
Kathmandu Metropolitan City ( KMC ) , in order to promote international relations has established an International Relations Secretariat ( IRC ) . KMC 's first international relationship was established in 1975 with the city of Eugene , Oregon , United States . This activity has been further enhanced by establishing formal relationships with 8 other cities : Motsumoto City of Japan , Rochester of the USA , Yangon ( formerly Rangoon ) of Myanmar , Xi'an of the People 's Republic of China , Minsk of Belarus , and Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea . KMC 's constant endeavor is to enhance its interaction with SAARC countries , other International agencies and many other major cities of the world to achieve better urban management and developmental programs for Kathmandu .
In what will be the case is Town of Greece v. Galloway , 12-696 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding whether prayers at town meetings , which are allowed , must allow various faiths to lead prayer , or whether the prayers can be predominately Christian . On May 5 , 2014 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the Town of Greece by holding that the U.S. Constitution not only allows for prayer at government meetings , but also for sectarian prayers like predominately Christian prayers .
Due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning , Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations . After selecting his budget director , Joseph M. Dodge , Eisenhower asked Herbert Brownell and Lucius Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments . He accepted their recommendations without exception ; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships , and one woman , Oveta Culp Hobby . Eisenhower 's cabinet , consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader , was dubbed by one journalist , " Eight millionaires and a plumber . " The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends , office seekers , or experienced government administrators . He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War .
In the wake of the Republic 's collapse , state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors . Augustus , the first Roman emperor , justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform . Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor . So-called " emperor worship " expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius , the divine tutelary of every individual . Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire . Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason . This was the context for Rome 's conflict with Christianity , which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio .
Baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah 's Witnesses . Jehovah 's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism , and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid . Individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them " as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses in association with God 's spirit-directed organization , " though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not " to a man , work or organization . " Their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to " his organization , " [ note 2 ] stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive God 's favor and to survive Armageddon .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point , often two or three packs a day . Eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia . He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . On September 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in Colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time Nixon , Dulles , and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President . He was treated by Dr. Paul Dudley White , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the President 's progress . Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome , gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages . 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore . The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period . Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings . In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti ( 462–472 , destroyed in 1589 ) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him , six on either side . At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara ( 468–483 , destroyed in 1686 ) Christ appeared in the center , flanked on either side by three Apostles . Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ . The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559 . The composition probably remained unchanged : Christ flanked by male and female saints , seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet . All three mosaics had a similar iconography .
According to Der Spiegel , credits given to European governments were disguised as " swaps " and consequently did not get registered as debt because Eurostat at the time ignored statistics involving financial derivatives . A German derivatives dealer had commented to Der Spiegel that " The Maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps , " and " In previous years , Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank . " These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union and the monetary union guidelines . In May 2010 , the Greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6 % which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP with Iceland in first place at 15.7 % and Great Britain third with 12.6 % . Public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit 120 % of GDP during 2010 .
A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances . The purposes of obstruction are several , such as frustrating the majority party 's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party . " We know how to delay , " remarked Minority Leader Gephardt Dilatory motions to adjourn , appeals of the presiding officer 's ruling , or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics . By stalling action on the majority party 's agenda , the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a " do-nothing Congress " and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House . To be sure , the minority leader recognizes that " going negative " carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public .

Shooting as practised in Britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farmed . Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns . When in position , " beaters " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . Such events are often called " drives " . The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August , the so-called Glorious Twelfth . The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the Game Act 1831 .
The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of Westchester County , one of the 12 original counties of the English Province of New York . The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns of Yonkers , Eastchester , and Pelham . In 1846 , a new town , West Farms , was created by division of Westchester ; in turn , in 1855 , the town of Morrisania was created from West Farms . In 1873 , the town of Kingsbridge ( roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge , Riverdale , and Woodlawn ) was established within the former borders of Yonkers .
Jefferson 's concept of " separation of church and state " first became a part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in Reynolds v. U.S. , 98 U.S. 145 ( 1878 ) . In that case , the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US , determining that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom , " The word 'religion ' is not defined in the Constitution . We must go elsewhere , therefore , to ascertain its meaning , and nowhere more appropriately , we think , than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted . " The court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson . Quoting the " separation " paragraph from Jefferson 's letter to the Danbury Baptists , the court concluded that , " coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure , it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured . "
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
The fire service , known as the Barun Yantra Karyalaya , opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle . An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for fire . As a precautionary measure , firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas . In 1944 , the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur . In 1966 , a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport . In 1975 , a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu 's fire service . The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization , the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal ( FAN ) , which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety .
Instruments like the duduk , the dhol , the zurna and the kanun are commonly found in Armenian folk music . Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music . One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia . Many of these chants are ancient in origin , extending to pre-Christian times , while others are relatively modern , including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots , the inventor of the Armenian alphabet . Whilst under Soviet rule , Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music , for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane .
The province is home to several historical sites , including the Shalimar Gardens , the Lahore Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Rohtas Fort and the ruins of the ancient city of Harrapa . The Anarkali Market and Jahangir 's Tomb are prominent in the city of Lahore as is the Lahore Museum , while the ancient city of Taxila in the northwest was once a major centre of Buddhist and Hindu influence . Several important Sikh shrines are in the province , including the birthplace of the first Guru , Guru Nanak . ( born at Nankana Sahib ) . There are a few famous hill stations , including Murree , Bhurban , Patriata and Fort Munro .
Eventually , the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram , founding the city of Kathmandu . The city was designed in the shape of Chandrahrasa , the sword of Manjushri . The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas . One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali ( in front of Singha Durbar ) . The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet , leading to tremendous growth in architecture . Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha , Kailaskut Bhawan , and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era . For example , the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan , the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma . The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well . The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era , both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas . Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia , creating religious art for their neighbors . For example , Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China . Bhrikuti , the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo , was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet .
^Note 5 : The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church , but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office . From 1835-1876 it allowed only Christians ( including Catholics ) to hold public office . Article VI , Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office . Such clauses were held by the United States Supreme Court to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v. Watkins , when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with First and Fourteenth Amendment protections .
Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere . After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526 , and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel , Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the " fallen city " of Geneva . His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life . After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559 , Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries . The faith continued to spread after Calvin 's death in 1563 .
In the instance when the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are controlled by one party , the Speaker normally assumes a lower profile and defers to the President . For that situation the House Minority Leader can play the role of a de facto " leader of the opposition " , often more so than the Senate Minority Leader , due to the more partisan nature of the House and the greater role of leadership . Minority Leaders who have played prominent roles in opposing the incumbent President have included Gerald Ford , Richard Gephardt , Nancy Pelosi , and John Boehner .
There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . Evangelicalism is a prominent example . Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism , some are Christian-wide . Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Roman Catholic Church , such as does it the Charismatic Movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity . Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement . Nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long , stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician . The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years . The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived . As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole , ice caps formed on it . Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America , which were south-polar locations at the time .
They can also be armed with non-lethal ( more accurately known as " less than lethal " or " less-lethal " ) weaponry , particularly for riot control . Non-lethal weapons include batons , tear gas , riot control agents , rubber bullets , riot shields , water cannons and electroshock weapons . Police officers often carry handcuffs to restrain suspects . The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life , although some jurisdictions ( such as Brazil ) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts . A " shoot-to-kill " policy was recently introduced in South Africa , which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians . With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime , president Jacob Zuma states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries .
The phrase " [ A ] hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world " was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams , the founder of the colony of Rhode Island , in his 1644 book The Bloody Tenent of Persecution . The phrase was later used by Thomas Jefferson as a description of the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government , in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists ( a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut ) :
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age . The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England . The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe , especially Geneva . The later Puritan movement , often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists , eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations .
Contemporary humanism entails a qualified optimism about the capacity of people , but it does not involve believing that human nature is purely good or that all people can live up to the Humanist ideals without help . If anything , there is recognition that living up to one 's potential is hard work and requires the help of others . The ultimate goal is human flourishing ; making life better for all humans , and as the most conscious species , also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole . The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now , and leaving the world a better place for those who come after . In 1925 , the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned : " The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled ; and man , who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels , has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature . It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts " .
Each camp had its own religious personnel ; standard bearers , priestly officers and their assistants , including a haruspex , and housekeepers of shrines and images . A senior magistrate-commander ( sometimes even a consul ) headed it , his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty . As in Rome , whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business ; legionary forts and vici included shrines to household gods , personal deities and deities otherwise unknown . From the earliest Imperial era , citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his familia on Imperial accessions , anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows . They celebrated Rome 's official festivals in absentia , and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire , Jupiter , Victoria and Concordia were typical . By the early Severan era , the military also offered cult to the Imperial divi , the current emperor 's numen , genius and domus ( or familia ) , and special cult to the Empress as " mother of the camp . " The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military concordia and Imperial loyalty .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Rome offers no native creation myth , and little mythography to explain the character of its deities , their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world , but Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales ( immortal gods ) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth . There were gods of the upper heavens , gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between . Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them , but none were intrinsically , irredeemably foreign or alien . The political , cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad , inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults . At different times and in different places , the sphere of influence , character and functions of a divine being could expand , overlap with those of others , and be redefined as Roman . Change was embedded within existing traditions .
In May 2014 , prior to the launch of YouTube 's subscription-based Music Key service , the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were " undervalued " in comparison to other streaming services , and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service . In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014 , Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service " to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms . " Stating that 90 % of labels had reached deals , he went on to say that " while we wish that we had [ a ] 100 % success rate , we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience . " The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels , for their inclusion in the service . However , YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal .
In the everyday world , many individuals sought to divine the future , influence it through magic , or seek vengeance with help from " private " diviners . The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods , not foretelling the future . Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect . So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit , subversive or magical purposes . Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times , notably in 139 BC and 33 BC . In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death . " Egyptian rites " were particularly suspect : Augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect ; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19 . Despite several Imperial bans , magic and astrology persisted among all social classes . In the late 1st century AD , Tacitus observed that astrologers " would always be banned and always retained at Rome " .
However , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , Steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the Arabian oryx , the Caspian and Javan tigers , the markhor , the Sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the North American cougar , the Altai argali sheep , the Asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . In the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
The Martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished . The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina , with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . The Greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina . The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily , dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia , the founder of the church .
In the Middle Ages , the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related . Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . Luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in Scripture ; 1523 ) . Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to Calvin 's system of church self-government . This system was taken over by the other reformed churches .
The Western emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , and against the protests of the senate , removed the altar of Victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals . Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire : in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults . He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house , but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple : the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors . Ambrose , the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint , wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus 's request for tolerance . Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus , and despite his active dismantling of Rome 's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms . [ clarification needed ] He was the last emperor of both East and West .
The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive , in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage . German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies . The British wanted Berlin , but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin , and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit . The British backed down , but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons . Washington refused to support Churchill 's plan to use Eisenhower 's army for political maneuvers against Moscow . The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon . The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very large-scale bloody battle , and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7 , 1945 .
Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals .
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy ( the Latin kings of Alba Longa ) with the well-known legend of Rome 's founding by Romulus and Remus . The most common version of the twins ' story displays several aspects of hero myth . Their mother , Rhea Silvia , had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin , in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father . Through divine intervention , the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars . She gave birth to twins , who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events .
Consistent with Calvin 's political ideas , Protestants created both the English and the American democracies . In seventeenth-century England , the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War , Oliver Cromwell , John Milton , John Locke , the Glorious Revolution , the English Bill of Rights , and the Act of Settlement . Later , the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies , e.g . Australia , New Zealand , and India . In North America , Plymouth Colony ( Pilgrim Fathers ; 1620 ) and Massachusetts Bay Colony ( 1628 ) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers . These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God . The Mayflower Compact was a social contract .
Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that " Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making . " Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles . They were diverse in style , rich in color and ornamental motifs , and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them , such as artsvagorgs ( eagle-carpets ) , vishapagorgs ( dragon-carpets ) and otsagorgs ( serpent-carpets ) . The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches , " covered with vegatative ornaments " , and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh .
The craft has also been popular in early medieval Rus , inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition . Yaroslav , the Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus ' built a large cathedral in his capital , Kiev . The model of the church was the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople , and it was also called Saint Sophia Cathedral . It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen , sent by Constantine Monomachos , between 1037 and 1046 . Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics . In the dome we can see the traditional stern Pantokrator supported by angels . Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives . The apse is dominated by an orant Theotokos with a Deesis in three medallions above . Below is a Communion of the Apostles .
Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie of the same name . They are set in the heart of the Bronx , showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor . In the 1979 film The Warriors , the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx , and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney Island in Brooklyn . A Bronx Tale ( 1993 ) depicts gang activities in the Belmont " Little Italy " section of the Bronx . The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham , Tremont , and " Gunhill " ( a play off the name Gun Hill Road ) . This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning , an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series ( 2007 ) about the New York Yankees ' drive to winning baseball 's 1977 World Series . The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team , led by manager Billy Martin , catcher Thurman Munson and outfielder Reggie Jackson , as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time , such as the blackout , the city 's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy , the arson for insurance payments , and the election of Ed Koch as mayor .
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
The necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas , garnering little criticism , though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment . The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation . Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology ( the doctrine of how the church as a body works ) , they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers , compared to the Catholics ' idea that certain people within the church , or ideas that were old enough , had a special status in giving understanding of the text .
Meanwhile , the authorities in Glasgow , Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 . Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . In Ireland , the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary . The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle . By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . In part , these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection . Thus , while there still is no cure for AIDS , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist . This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley 's death . Because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques , some microbes require culture within live animals . Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals , although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary . Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals . Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs . Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis , or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent . Chagas disease is the most significant example , because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent , Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient , which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis . In this case , xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi , an uninfected triatomine bug , which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected . The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut .
The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway theaters , many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa . The Pregones Theater , which produces Latin American work , opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx . Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area , and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002 . However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area .
The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal , comprising in Cicero 's enumeration the gall bladder ( fel ) , liver ( iecur ) , heart ( cor ) , and lungs ( pulmones ) . The exta were exposed for litatio ( divine approval ) as part of Roman liturgy , but were " read " in the context of the disciplina Etrusca . As a product of Roman sacrifice , the exta and blood are reserved for the gods , while the meat ( viscera ) is shared among human beings in a communal meal . The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot ( olla or aula ) , while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers . When the deity 's portion was cooked , it was sprinkled with mola salsa ( ritually prepared salted flour ) and wine , then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering ; the technical verb for this action was porricere .
Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by " prefects " for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period . In Jin , dozens of prefects were spread across the state , each having limited authority and employment period . They were appointed by local magistrates , who reported to higher authorities such as governors , who in turn were appointed by the emperor , and they oversaw the civil administration of their " prefecture " , or jurisdiction . Under each prefect were " subprefects " who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area . Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations , much like modern police detectives . Prefects could also be women . The concept of the " prefecture system " spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan .
All police officers in the United Kingdom , whatever their actual rank , are 'constables ' in terms of their legal position . This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner . However , certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations , such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect 's house ( section 18 PACE in England and Wales ) by an officer of the rank of Inspector , or the power to authorize a suspect 's detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent .
By contrast , Tom Wolfe 's Bonfire of the Vanities ( 1987 ) portrays a wealthy , white protagonist , Sherman McCoy , getting lost off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx and having an altercation with locals . A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse . However , times change , and in 2007 , the New York Times reported that " the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman 's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments . " In the same article , the Reverend Al Sharpton ( whose fictional analogue in the novel is " Reverend Bacon " ) asserts that " twenty years later , the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities is as out of style as Tom Wolfe 's wardrobe . "
The Arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East . However , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “ extinct in the wild ” to “ vulnerable ” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
Brasília has also been the focus of modern-day literature . Published in 2008 , The World In Grey : Dom Bosco 's Prophecy , by author Ryan J. Lucero , tells an apocalypticle story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco . According to Don Bosco 's prophecy : " Between parallels 15 and 20 , around a lake which shall be formed ; A great civilization will thrive , and that will be the Promised Land . " Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S , where an artificial lake ( Paranoá Lake ) was formed . Don Bosco is Brasília 's patron saint .
Jefferson 's letter entered American jurisprudence in the 1878 Mormon polygamy case Reynolds v. U.S. , in which the court cited Jefferson and Madison , seeking a legal definition for the word religion . Writing for the majority , Justice Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson 's Letter to the Danbury Baptists to state that " Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion , but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order . " Considering this , the court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional .
The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The large villa rustica , which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century . The most important pieces are the Circus Scene , the 64m long Great Hunting Scene , the Little Hunt , the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis . The peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered . The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus , Alexander the Great 's Hunt and the Four Seasons .
Kathmandu is home to Nepali cinema and theaters . The city contains several theaters , including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path , the Ganga Theatre , the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982 . The M. Art Theater is based in the city . The Gurukul School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theater Festival , attracting artists from all over the world . A mini theater is also located at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square , established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee .
Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population densities or limited topographic relief . Regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .
From an institutional perspective , the rules of the House assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader . For example , Rule XII , clause 6 , grant the minority leader ( or his designee ) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions ; Rule II , clause 6 , states the Inspector General shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the Speaker , majority leader , and minority leader ; and Rule XV , clause 6 , provides that the Speaker , after consultation with the minority leader , may place legislation on the Corrections Calendar . The minority leader also has other institutional duties , such as appointing individuals to certain federal entities .
YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno , California , United States . The service was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005 . In November 2006 , it was bought by Google for US $ 1.65 billion . YouTube now operates as one of Google 's subsidiaries . The site allows users to upload , view , rate , share , and comment on videos , and it makes use of WebM , H.264/MPEG-4 AVC , and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video . Available content includes video clips , TV clips , music videos , movie trailers , and other content such as video blogging , short original videos , and educational videos .
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age . The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England . The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe , especially Geneva . The later Puritan movement , often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists , eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations .
Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches , having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon . Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion , not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion . During its later political eclipses , Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin . However , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of Armenia , made the political power move to safer places . The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . Therefore , it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia .
The U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it , due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal . Indeed , Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons , while reducing conventional forces , and with them the overall defense budget , a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162/2 . This approach became known as the " New Look " , and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953 .
In addition to the above , Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea , as well as the Libyan Sea , within the Greek exclusive economic zone , south of Crete . The Ministry of the Environment , Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including Norway and the United States ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012 . In November 2012 , a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion .
The impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of Rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion . In this spirit , a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
A 5th-century building in Huldah may be a Samaritan synagogue . Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols ( menorah , lulav , etrog ) but the inscriptions are Greek . Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an ( excavated in 1960 ) . The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule ( shrine ) with cultic symbols . The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town ( see above ) . The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue . One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script .
The Bronx has several local newspapers , including The Bronx News , Parkchester News , City News , The Riverdale Press , Riverdale Review , The Bronx Times Reporter , Inner City Press ( which now has more of a focus on national issues ) and Co-Op City Times . Four non-profit news outlets , Norwood News , Mount Hope Monitor , Mott Haven Herald and The Hunts Point Express serve the borough 's poorer communities . The editor and co-publisher of The Riverdale Press , Bernard Stein , won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998 . ( Stein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959 . )
The original charter of the Province of East Jersey had restricted membership in the Assembly to Christians ; the Duke of York was fervently Catholic , and the proprietors of Perth Amboy , New Jersey were Scottish Catholic peers . The Province of West Jersey had declared , in 1681 , that there should be no religious test for office . An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian War requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope , which may or may not have been applied during the Revolution . That law was replaced by 1799 .
Also , other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants . For example , torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740 , slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 ( William Wilberforce , Harriet Beecher Stowe , Abraham Lincoln - against Southern Protestants ) . Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law . The Geneva Convention , an important part of humanitarian international law , was largely the work of Henry Dunant , a reformed pietist . He also founded the Red Cross .
Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith ( see Christian Humanism ) . They inveighed against the abuses of the Church , but not against the Church itself , much less against religion . For them , the word " secular " carried no connotations of disbelief – that would come later , in the nineteenth century . In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery . Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo 's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own ( although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life ) . He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue , inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer . By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base , however , the methods of the humanists , combined with their eloquence , would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority .
In the 1970s , the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson . The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities , like the South Bronx . The most common explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area . The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment , which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx .
Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem between 1042 and 1048 . Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel , who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description : " Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling , over the tribune . The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ . In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exhaltation of Adam . In the apse the Ascension of Christ . The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar . "
In 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament . The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections . In talks located in London that year , they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections ; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower , when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections . In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria , and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S. , U.K. and France . At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called " Open Skies " to facilitate disarmament , which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other 's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure . Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand .
Jefferson 's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity , but this was a caricature . In setting up the University of Virginia , Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own , though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity , arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom . Some have argued that this arrangement was " fully compatible with Jefferson 's views on the separation of church and state ; " however , others point to Jefferson 's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation . Still other scholars , such as Mark David Hall , attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history
In contrast , Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline . The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose . According to the government of Botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as poaching , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . Uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [ Uganda 's ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
Kathmandu is located in the northwestern part of the Kathmandu Valley to the north of the Bagmati River and covers an area of 50.67 km2 ( 19.56 sq mi ) . The average elevation is 1,400 metres ( 4,600 ft ) above sea level . The city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley : south of the Bagmati by Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City ( Patan ) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road , to the southwest by Kirtipur Municipality and to the east by Madyapur Thimi Municipality . To the north the urban area extends into several Village Development Committees . However , the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities , e. g. to Bhaktapur and just about covers the entire Kathmandu valley .
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a " spy-plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . As a result , the Eisenhower Administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over Turkey . The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Constantine 's nephew Julian rejected the " Galilean madness " of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism , Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult . Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism , attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights . He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem 's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the " irrational impieties " of Christian doctrine . His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate , with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia , after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned . The empire once again fell under Christian control , this time permanently .
Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point , often two or three packs a day . Eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia . He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . On September 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in Colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time Nixon , Dulles , and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President . He was treated by Dr. Paul Dudley White , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the President 's progress . Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
World War II ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country 's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle . From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average , peaking at 5.8 % in 2003 and 5.7 % in 2006 . The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider European debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real GDP growth rates of −0.3 % in 2008 , −4.3 % in 2009 , −5.5 % in 2010 , −9.1 % in 2011 , −7.3 % in 2012 and −3.2 % in 2013 . In 2011 , the country 's public debt reached €356 billion ( 172 % of nominal GDP ) . After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector , Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion ( 137 % of GDP ) in the first quarter of 2012 . Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7 % in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline , but fell back into recession in 2015 .
The Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to the King Tribhuvan ( 1906–1955 ) . It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings , letters and papers , memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members . The Mahendra Museum is dedicated to king Mahendra of Nepal ( 1920–1972 ) . Like the Tribhuvan Museum , it includes his personal belongings such as decorations , stamps , coins and personal notes and manuscripts , but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber . The Hanumandhoka Palace , a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar , contains three separate museums of historic importance . These museums include the Birendra museum , which contains items related to the second-last monarch , Birendra of Nepal .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
Rome 's diplomatic agreement with her neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine . and established on the Aventine in the " commune Latinorum Dianae templum " : At about the same time , the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount , its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome 's inclusive hegemony . Rome 's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the pomoerium : and the cult to Hercules at the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur . and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum : Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy , and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste . In 217 , Venus was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that God 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 " spirit-anointed " Christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with Jesus ' reference to a " new covenant " . The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus ' ministry on earth . They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth .
Eisenhower 's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U.S. Army 's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy . He was assigned as an observer for the mission , which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast . His subsequent experience with encountering German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System . Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country , he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations , but provide a measure of continued economic growth . The legislation initially stalled in the Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project , but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by Eisenhower in June 1956 .
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented . After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the Forum Boarium , in a stone chamber " which had on a previous occasion [ 228 BC ] also been polluted by human victims , a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings " . Livy avoids the word " sacrifice " in connection with this bloodless human life-offering ; Plutarch does not . The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC , preparatory to an invasion of Gaul . Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain .
Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination . More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient . Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features , by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens , and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype . Other techniques ( such as X-rays , CAT scans , PET scans or NMR ) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent . The images are useful in detection of , for example , a bone abscess or a spongiform encephalopathy produced by a prion .

The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising Hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the Muslim Umayyad army led by Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712 , by defeating Raja Dahir . The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad . It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty , whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams , the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph . Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of Mecca , their capital was Damascus . Muhammad bin Qasim was the first to bring message of Islam to the population of Punjab . [ citation needed ] Punjab was part of different Muslim Empires consisting of Afghans and Turkic peoples in co-operation with local Punjabi tribes and others . [ citation needed ] In the 11th century , during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni , the province became an important centre with Lahore as its second capital [ citation needed ] of the Ghaznavid Empire based out of Afghanistan . The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region .
All YouTube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration . Users who have a good track record of complying with the site 's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length , which requires verifying the account , normally through a mobile phone . When YouTube was launched in 2005 , it was possible to upload long videos , but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films . The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010 . If an up-to-date browser version is used , videos greater than 20 GB can be uploaded .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]
On the whole , Eisenhower 's support of the nation 's fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 , gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world . He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . His Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created NASA as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and fostered improved relations with American scientists .
Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower 's combat command skills ; during the initial phase of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel 's move into the Kasserine Pass , Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates . He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall , commanding U.S. II Corps . He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns . In February 1943 , his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British Eighth Army , commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery . The Eighth Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign . Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA .
Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized , the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation . On the contrary , the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation . The Magisterial reformers , such as Martin Luther , John Calvin , and Huldrych Zwingli , believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church , which they viewed as having become corrupted . Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation , denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them . In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church , Protestants often posited a new argument , saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority , only a spiritual , invisible , and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation .
Prior to his inauguration , Eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor addressing foremost issues ; agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term , to bring the Korean War to an end , to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent , and to end price and wage controls . Eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 ; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist Russia policy . His inaugural address , as well , was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy , as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the United Nations .
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
Believers in Pashupatinath ( mainly Hindus ) are allowed to enter the temple premises , but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River . The priests who perform the services at this temple have been Brahmins from Karnataka , South India since the time of Malla king Yaksha Malla . This tradition is believed to have been started at the request of Adi Shankaracharya who sought to unify the states of Bharatam ( Unified India ) by encouraging cultural exchange . This procedure is followed in other temples around India , which were sanctified by Adi Shankaracharya .
An error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece ’ s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives ’ deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to " hide " 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece ’ s Eurozone entry .
Several versions of a semi-official , structured pantheon were developed during the political , social and religious instability of the Late Republican era . Jupiter , the most powerful of all gods and " the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested " , consistently personified the divine authority of Rome 's highest offices , internal organization and external relations . During the archaic and early Republican eras , he shared his temple , some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus , who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva . A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres , Liber and Libera , and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult . Other major and minor deities could be single , coupled , or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure . These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic , part philosophical creations , and often Greek in origin . The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians , and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage .
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered . The most important one was uncovered in 1990 . It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual . The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century . In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed . They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals , and personifications of the Seasons , Ocean , Earth and Wisdom .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
Jefferson 's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly by the U.S. Supreme Court . In Reynolds v. United States ( 1879 ) the Court wrote that Jefferson 's comments " may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [ First ] Amendment . " In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , Justice Hugo Black wrote : " In the words of Thomas Jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state . "
A Protestant baptism is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize . However , as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of apostolic succession and the disunity from Catholic Church , all other sacraments ( except marriage ) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid . Therefore , Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized ( although they are confirmed ) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a period of study .
Disease can arise if the host 's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host . Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes . For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis . Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts . For example , less than 5 % of individuals infected with polio develop disease . On the other hand , some infectious agents are highly virulent . The prion causing mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected .
Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ) Alliance with the U.K. , France , New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism . At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks ; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer . After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam , Eisenhower rejected the agreement , offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam . Ambrose argues that Eisenhower , by not participating in the Geneva agreement , had kept the U.S out of Vietnam ; nevertheless , with the formation of SEATO , he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict .
Between 2005 and 2011 , Greece has had the highest percentage increase in industrial output compared to 2005 levels out of all European Union members , with an increase of 6 % . Eurostat statistics show that the industrial sector was hit by the Greek financial crisis throughout 2009 and 2010 , with domestic output decreasing by 5.8 % and industrial production in general by 13.4 % . Currently , Greece is ranked third in the European Union in the production of marble ( over 920,000 tons ) , after Italy and Spain .
The fire service , known as the Barun Yantra Karyalaya , opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single vehicle . An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for fire . As a precautionary measure , firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas . In 1944 , the fire service was extended to the neighboring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur . In 1966 , a fire service was established in Kathmandu airport . In 1975 , a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu 's fire service . The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization , the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal ( FAN ) , which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety .
On January 17 , 1961 , Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office . In his farewell speech , Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces . He described the Cold War : " We face a hostile ideology global in scope , atheistic in character , ruthless in purpose and insidious in method ... " and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that " we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military–industrial complex . "
Greece 's rail network is estimated to be at 2,548 km . Rail transport in Greece is operated by TrainOSE , a subsidiary of the Hellenic Railways Organization ( OSE ) . Most of the country 's network is standard gauge ( 1,565 km ) , while the country also has 983 km of narrow gauge . A total of 764 km of rail are electrified . Greece has rail connections with Bulgaria , the Republic of Macedonia and Turkey . A total of three suburban railway systems ( Proastiakos ) are in operation ( in Athens , Thessaloniki and Patras ) , while one metro system is operational in Athens with another under construction .
The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the President of Brazil . It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília . As the seat of government , the term " Planalto " is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government . The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto . The President and his or her family do not live in it , rather in the official residence , the Palácio da Alvorada . Besides the President , senior advisors also have offices in the " Planalto , " including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff . The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios . The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer , creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília . The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures . The Palace is four stories high , and has an area of 36,000 m2 . Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex .
The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges , running south to north . The West Bronx has older apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as Riverdale and Fieldston . It includes New York City 's fourth largest park : Van Cortlandt Park along the Westchester-Bronx border . The Grand Concourse , a wide boulevard , runs through it , north to south .
The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia , itself a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia , was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion ( it had formerly been adherent to Armenian paganism , which was influenced by Zoroastrianism , while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with Greco-Roman deities ) . in the early years of the 4th century , likely AD 301 , partly in defiance of the Sassanids it seems . In the late Parthian period , Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land , but by the Christianisation , previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined . Later on , in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity , Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet , in 405 AD . This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia , during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop 's pupils . Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires , until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived .
In 1797 , Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames , to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo . The idea of a police , as it then existed in France , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import . In building the case for the police in the face of England 's firm anti-police sentiment , Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was " perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution . " Moreover , he went so far as to praise the French system , which had reached " the greatest degree of perfection " in his estimation .
Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later Middle Ages and the Early Modern period . The 19th-century German historian Georg Voigt ( 1827–91 ) identified Petrarch as the first Renaissance humanist . Paul Johnson agrees that Petrarch was " the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness " . According to Petrarch , what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors . For Petrarch and Boccaccio , the greatest master was Cicero , whose prose became the model for both learned ( Latin ) and vernacular ( Italian ) prose .
Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few Americans actually hunt . At the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of Americans hunted . Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states , where twelve percent of Midwesterners hunted . Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . Overall , in the 1996–2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . In part , these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection . Thus , while there still is no cure for AIDS , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual ; in effect they were Rome in miniature . The commander 's headquarters stood at the centre ; he took the auspices on a dais in front . A small building behind housed the legionary standards , the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era , the image of the ruling emperor . In one camp , this shrine is even called Capitolium . The most important camp-offering appears to have been the suovetaurilia performed before a major , set battle . A ram , a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded , led around the outer perimeter of the camp ( a lustratio exercitus ) and in through a gate , then sacrificed : Trajan 's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars . The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine templum ; all within are purified and protected .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
In the years that followed , Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men . This was due to North Vietnam 's support of " uprisings " in the south and concern the nation would fall . In May 1957 Diem , then President of South Vietnam , made a state visit to the United States for ten days . President Eisenhower pledged his continued support , and a parade was held in Diem 's honor in New York City . Although Diem was publicly praised , in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives .
Like other neighborhoods in New York City , the South Bronx has no official boundaries . The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s Fordham Road was often used as a northern limit . The Bronx River more consistently forms an eastern boundary . The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multi-unit homes . The South Bronx is home to the Bronx County Courthouse , Borough Hall , and other government buildings , as well as Yankee Stadium . The Cross Bronx Expressway bisects it , east to west . The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country , as well as very high crime areas .
During the Permian all the Earth 's major land masses , except portions of East Asia , were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea . Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles , with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean ( Panthalassa , the universal sea ) , and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana . The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia , causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink . A new ocean was growing on its southern end , the Tethys Ocean , an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era . Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ( " continental climate " ) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns . Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea .
Various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
Today , this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader . Less commonly , it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself . The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways . Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism , though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole . Broadly speaking , Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things — in salvation but also in all of life . This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity .
Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube 's running costs , and YouTube 's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing . In June 2008 , a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $ 200 million , noting progress in advertising sales . In January 2012 , it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site , in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical U.S. citizen watching television . In 2012 , YouTube 's revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion . In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to eMarketer , others estimated 4.7 billion ,
Egypt recognises only three religions : Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians , such as the small Bahá'í and Ahmadi community , are not recognised by the state and face persecution since they are labelled as far right groups that threaten Egypt 's national security . Individuals , particularly Baha'is and atheists , wishing to include their religion ( or lack thereof ) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability ( see Egyptian identification card controversy ) , and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith . A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank .
Robert S. Wood has argued that the United States is a model for the world in terms of how a separation of church and state—no state-run or state-established church—is good for both the church and the state , allowing a variety of religions to flourish . Speaking at the Toronto-based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a " remarkable religiosity " in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on " a sort of civic religion , " which includes a generally-shared belief in a creator who " expects better of us . " Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience . He calls this approach the " genius of religious sentiment in the United States . "
Due to its location , the Punjab region came under constant attacks and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the Greeks , Kushans , Scythians , Turks , and Afghans . The city of Taxila , founded by son of Taksh the son Bharat who was the brother of Ram . It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world , [ citation needed ] Takshashila University . One of the teachers was the great Vedic thinker and politician Chanakya . Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the Maurya Empire . It is a UN World Heritage site , valued for its archaeological and religious history .
In the United States and elsewhere in the world , there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations , especially those that are more exclusively evangelical , and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches . In the post–World War I era , Liberal Christianity was on the rise , and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well . In the post–World War II era , the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America 's seminaries and church structures .
Wherever the Magisterial Reformation , which received support from the ruling authorities , took place , the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church , but disagreeing , in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice , with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters , namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church . The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity , founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement , rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils , but rejecting the latest ecumenical council , the Council of Trent . Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character , wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ , not common identity , doctrine , belief , and collaborative action .
Greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development . The Greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to Japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . Additionally , Greece represents 39.52 % of all of the European Union 's dwt . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .
The main international airport serving Kathmandu and thus Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport , located about six kilometers ( 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) ) from the city centre . Operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal it has two terminals , one domestic and one international . At present , about 22 international airlines connect Nepal to other destinations in Europe , Asia and the Middle East , to cities such as Istanbul , Delhi , Kolkata , Singapore , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , Dhaka , Islamabad , Paro , Lhasa , Chengdu , and Guangzhou . A recent extension to the international terminal has made the distance to the airplanes shorter and in October 2009 it became possible to fly directly to Kathmandu from Amsterdam with Arkefly . Since 2013 , Turkish Airlines connects Istanbul to Kathmandu . Regionally , several Nepali airlines operate from the city , including Agni Air , Buddha Air , Cosmic Air , Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines , to other major towns across Nepal .
Armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . Arguably the favorite food is khorovats an Armenian-styled barbecue . Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread , and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . Also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture . Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet . Apricots ( Prunus armeniaca , also known as Armenian Plum ) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . Peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . Preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
These critics of the modern separation of church and state also note the official establishment of religion in several of the states at the time of ratification , to suggest that the modern incorporation of the Establishment Clause as to state governments goes against the original constitutional intent . [ citation needed ] The issue is complex , however , as the incorporation ultimately bases on the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 , at which point the first amendment 's application to the state government was recognized . Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern , progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution . Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution 's Supremacy Clause , but also by legal precedence , making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era , and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution .
A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g . to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the University of Toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . For example , humans can make neither RNA replicases nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
In 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament . The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections . In talks located in London that year , they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections ; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower , when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections . In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria , and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S. , U.K. and France . At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called " Open Skies " to facilitate disarmament , which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other 's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure . Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand .
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists , and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks , and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side . According to the Nepali Hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation . The chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .
Among the Punjabi poets , the names of Sultan Bahu , Bulleh Shah , Mian Muhammad Baksh , and Waris Shah and folk singers like Inayat Hussain Bhatti and Tufail Niazi , Alam Lohar , Sain Marna , Mansoor Malangi , Allah Ditta Lona wala , Talib Hussain Dard , Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi , Gamoo Tahliwala , Mamzoo Gha-lla , Akbar Jat , Arif Lohar , Ahmad Nawaz Cheena and Hamid Ali Bela are well-known . In the composition of classical ragas , there are such masters as Malika-i-Mauseequi ( Queen of Music ) Roshan Ara Begum , Ustad Amanat Ali Khan , Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Fateh Ali Khan . Alam Lohar has made significant contributions to folklore and Punjabi literature , by being a very influential Punjabi folk singer from 1930 until 1979 .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches , having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon . Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion , not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion . During its later political eclipses , Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin . However , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of Armenia , made the political power move to safer places . The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . Therefore , it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia .
Early in 1953 , the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists , supplied from China , who were fighting the First Indochina War . Eisenhower sent Lt. General John W. " Iron Mike " O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there . Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary . Eisenhower stated prophetically that " this war would absorb our troops by divisions . "
The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition . These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . By the end of the century , the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles .
The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture . The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices . The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings . In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site ( WHS ) . The seven monuments zones cover an area of 188.95 hectares ( 466.9 acres ) , with the buffer zone extending to 239.34 hectares ( 591.4 acres ) . The Seven Monument Zones ( Mzs ) inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka , Patan and Bhaktapur , Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan , the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Boudhanath .
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iPhone applications . Today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . In 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] In the US , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole . An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct . Jainism is practiced by a small community . A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar , where Jains practice their faith . According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal , there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley . They have a National Office located in Shantinagar , Baneshwor . The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu . Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of Nepal . [ citation needed ] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches . Christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies , who had converted to Christianity while in service , on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion . They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu , in particular .
The base of the stupa has 108 small depictions of the Dhyani Buddha Amitabha . It is surrounded with a brick wall with 147 niches , each with four or five prayer wheels engraved with the mantra , om mani padme hum . At the northern entrance where visitors must pass is a shrine dedicated to Ajima , the goddess of smallpox . Every year the stupa attracts many Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims who perform full body prostrations in the inner lower enclosure , walk around the stupa with prayer wheels , chant , and pray . Thousands of prayer flags are hoisted up from the top of the stupa downwards and dot the perimeter of the complex . The influx of many Tibetan refugees from China has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan gompas ( monasteries ) around Boudhanath .
A scientific study in the journal , Biological Conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism . " However , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
Between 1949 and the 1980s , telephone communications in Greece were a state monopoly by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization , better known by its acronym , OTE . Despite the liberalization of telephone communications in the country in the 1980s , OTE still dominates the Greek market in its field and has emerged as one of the largest telecommunications companies in Southeast Europe . Since 2011 , the company 's major shareholder is Deutsche Telekom with a 40 % stake , while the Greek state continues to own 10 % of the company 's shares . OTE owns several subsidiaries across the Balkans , including Cosmote , Greece 's top mobile telecommunications provider , Cosmote Romania and Albanian Mobile Communications .
The literal meaning of Durbar Square is a " place of palaces " . There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in Kirtipur . The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is located in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms ( Kantipur , Lalitpur , Bhaktapur , Kirtipur ) ; the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty . The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square . The outer quadrangle has the Kasthamandap , Kumari Ghar , and Shiva-Parvati Temple ; the inner quadrangle has the Hanuman Dhoka palace . The squares were severely damaged in the April 2015 Nepal earthquake .
While the Armenian Apostolic Church remains the most prominent church in the Armenian community throughout the world , Armenians ( especially in the diaspora ) subscribe to any number of other Christian denominations . These include the Armenian Catholic Church ( which follows its own liturgy but recognizes the Roman Catholic Pope ) , the Armenian Evangelical Church , which started as a reformation in the Mother church but later broke away , and the Armenian Brotherhood Church , which was born in the Armenian Evangelical Church , but later broke apart from it . There are other numerous Armenian churches belonging to Protestant denominations of all kinds .
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectious Disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology . Generally , infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists . For example , an " uncomplicated " pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist ( lung physician ) . The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners , as well as laboratory scientists , immunologists , bacteriologists and other specialists .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
Pentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations , including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ , both in the United States and elsewhere . There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide , and the movement is growing in many parts of the world , especially the global South . Since the 1960s , Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions , and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement . Together , Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents .
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . As a representative of the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) explained , " The NRA has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . Sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
Promote and Publicize the Party 's Agenda . An important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independents and swing voters . Despite the minority leader 's restricted ability to set the House 's agenda , there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities . For example , the minority leader may employ , or threaten to use , discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor . If he or she is able to attract the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting majority party supporters , he or she can force minority initiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership . As a GOP minority leader once said , the challenges he confronted are to " keep our people together , and to look for votes on the other side . "
The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma . During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana . Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and , as the period progressed , drifted toward the South Pole . Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia , Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents ( since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier ) , but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period , causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them . Also , Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia . The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this . By the end of the period , Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated .
The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages . In 1873 , the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge , West Farms and Morrisania to New York , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . In 1895 , three years before New York 's consolidation with Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island , the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River , including the Town of Westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham , were annexed to the city . City Island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet . [ note 5 ] Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " .
The ad fontes principle also had many applications . The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as Epicureanism , and Neoplatonism , whose Pagan wisdom the humanists , like the Church fathers of old , tended , at least initially , to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue . The line from a drama of Terence , Homo sum , humani nihil a me alienum puto ( or with nil for nihil ) , meaning " I am a human being , I think nothing human alien to me " , known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine , gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude . The statement , in a play modeled or borrowed from a ( now lost ) Greek comedy by Menander , may have originated in a lighthearted vein – as a comic rationale for an old man 's meddling – but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning , by Cicero and Saint Augustine , to name a few , and most notably by Seneca . Richard Bauman writes :
In France during the Middle Ages , there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities : The Marshal of France and the Constable of France . The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal 's provost , whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal . The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years ' 'War , and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century . Another organisation , the Constabulary ( French : Connétablie ) , was under the command of the Constable of France . The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337 . Under King Francis I ( who reigned 1515–1547 ) , the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary . The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée , or , formally , the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France .
Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra , composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran . Zarathustra 's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda ( God in the form of supreme wisdom ) . The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic divine God/Grand Architect of the universe tied with a unique eschatology and ethical system implying that each person is held morally responsible for their choices , made freely in this present life , in the afterlife . The importance placed on thought , action , responsibility , and a non-intervening creator was appealed to by , and inspired a number of , Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu .
In 2014 , the airport received 15 new boarding bridges , totalling 28 in all . This was the main requirement made by the federal government , which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction . The group invested R $ 750 million in the project . In the same year , the number of parking spaces doubled , reaching three thousand . The airport 's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road . Furthermore , a VIP room was created on Terminal 1 's third floor . The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília 's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014 . Brasília has direct flights to all states of Brazil and direct international flights to Atlanta , Buenos Aires , Lisbon , Miami , Panama City , and Paris .
Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time , a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , only 70 miles from his ancestral home in Elizabethville , Dauphin County , Pennsylvania . In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the National Park Service . In retirement , the former president did not completely retreat from political life ; he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg . However , his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as " a dime-store New Dealer " .
In Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97 ( 1968 ) , the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime " to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals , " or " to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches " this theory in any school or university that received public funds . The court 's opinion , written by Justice Abe Fortas , ruled that the Arkansas law violated " the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . The overriding fact is that Arkansas ' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine ; that is , with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group . " The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion , and that " [ T ] he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them .
