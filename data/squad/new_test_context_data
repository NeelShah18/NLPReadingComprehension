The Chief Deputy Whip is the primary assistant to the whip , who is the chief vote counter for his or her party . The current chief deputy majority whip is Republican Patrick McHenry . Within the House Republican Conference , the chief deputy whip is the highest appointed position and often a launching pad for future positions in the House Leadership . The House Democratic Conference has multiple chief deputy whips , led by a Senior Chief Deputy Whip , which is the highest appointed position within the House Democratic Caucus . The current senior chief deputy minority whip , John Lewis , has held his post since 1991 .
Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of India and Pakistan in the wars of 1965 and 1971 . Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan 's nuclear program such as Kahuta . It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi . The peace process between India and Pakistan , which began in earnest in 2004 , has helped pacify the situation . Trade and people-to-people contacts through the Wagah border are now starting to become common . Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as Nankana Sahib .
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . Man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . Hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] For example , Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
Portuguese pavement ( in Portuguese , Calçada Portuguesa ) is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal , and common throughout the Lusosphere . Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex , it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design . In Portuguese-speaking countries , many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even , though far more occasionally , streets done in this mosaic form . Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style .
The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation , based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura ( by scripture alone ) . This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible : that its teaching is needed for salvation ( necessity ) ; that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone ( sufficiency ) ; that everything taught in the Bible is correct ( inerrancy ) ; and that , by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin , believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself , though understanding is difficult , so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church ( clarity ) .
There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . Evangelicalism is a prominent example . Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism , some are Christian-wide . Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Roman Catholic Church , such as does it the Charismatic Movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity . Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement . Nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
Prior to his inauguration , Eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor addressing foremost issues ; agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term , to bring the Korean War to an end , to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent , and to end price and wage controls . Eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 ; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist Russia policy . His inaugural address , as well , was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy , as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the United Nations .
Since the late 1980s , significant development has occurred in the Bronx , first stimulated by the city 's " Ten-Year Housing Plan " and community members working to rebuild the social , economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing . Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units . The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos ' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx . The IRT White Plains Road Line ( 2 5 trains ) began to show an increase in riders . Chains such as Marshalls , Staples , and Target opened stores in the Bronx . More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole ( rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007 ) , although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods , while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs .
Second , Democrats have always elevated their minority floor leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority status . Republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern . In 1919 , for instance , Republicans bypassed James R. Mann , R-IL , who had been minority leader for eight years , and elected Frederick Gillett , R-MA , to be Speaker . Mann " had angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor ; " also he was a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Cannon , R-IL ( 1903–1911 ) , and many Members " suspected that he would try to re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker . " More recently , although Robert H. Michel was the Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections , he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign , including the Contract with America which was unveiled six weeks before voting day .
The city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu . Most of Kathmandu 's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism . There are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . English is understood by Kathmandu 's educated residents . Historic areas of Kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April 2015 .
In contrast to the Proterozoic , Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments , such as graywackes , mudstones , volcanic sediments and banded iron formations . Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations , consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks . The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs , while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin . In short , greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents .
Antarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap . Mountain building in western North America continued , and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African plate continued to push north into the Eurasian plate , isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea . A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe . There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . During the Oligocene , South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America . It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow , rapidly cooling the continent .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
The court noted that it " is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America . " The lone dissenter , Justice Potter Stewart , objected to the court 's embrace of the " wall of separation " metaphor : " I think that the Court 's task , in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication , is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the " wall of separation , " a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution . "
In the later Imperial era , the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped . Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members , and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica . The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued ; St Augustine ( following St Ambrose ) feared that this invited the " drunken " practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor . Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567 . Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different . Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution ; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life . The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics , and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to " new life " .

Collectively encompassing more than 900 million adherents , or nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide , Protestantism is present on all populated continents . [ t ] The movement is more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than either Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism , lacking both structural unity and central human authority . Some Protestant churches do have a worldwide scope and distribution of membership ( notably , the Anglican Communion ) , while others are confined to a single country , or even are solitary church bodies or congregations ( such as the former Prussian Union of churches ) . Nondenominational , evangelical , independent and other churches are on the rise , and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity .
In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term Humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the English language in this sense . The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when German historian and philologist Georg Voigt used humanism to describe Renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the Italian Renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially Italy .
The exta were the entrails of a sacrificed animal , comprising in Cicero 's enumeration the gall bladder ( fel ) , liver ( iecur ) , heart ( cor ) , and lungs ( pulmones ) . The exta were exposed for litatio ( divine approval ) as part of Roman liturgy , but were " read " in the context of the disciplina Etrusca . As a product of Roman sacrifice , the exta and blood are reserved for the gods , while the meat ( viscera ) is shared among human beings in a communal meal . The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot ( olla or aula ) , while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers . When the deity 's portion was cooked , it was sprinkled with mola salsa ( ritually prepared salted flour ) and wine , then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering ; the technical verb for this action was porricere .
Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill , George S. Patton , George Marshall , and General Montgomery during World War II . Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with MacArthur , and that a positive relationship endured . While in Manila , Mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully . Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936 . He also learned to fly , making a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilot 's license in 1939 at Fort Lewis . Also around this time , he was offered a post by the Philippine Commonwealth Government , namely by then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur , to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned , now named Quezon City , but he declined the offer .
The location and terrain of Kathmandu have played a significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia . The city is located in an ancient lake basin , with fertile soil and flat terrain . This geography helped form a society based on agriculture . This , combined with its location between India and China , helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading center over the centuries . Kathmandu 's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet . From centuries past , Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia . Other traditional occupations are farming , metal casting , woodcarving , painting , weaving , and pottery .
A national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state . Some national universities are closely associated with national cultural or political aspirations , for instance the National University of Ireland in the early days of Irish independence collected a large amount of information on the Irish language and Irish culture . Reforms in Argentina were the result of the University Revolution of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system .
Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization , it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected . Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs . A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association 's " Rational Clinical Examination Series " quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection . The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( LR ) range , 11-20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0.64-0.88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary LR 0.64-0.88 ) .
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women , including many Armenian families . Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region , referred to as Artsakh ( see also Karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of Banants ( near Gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . The first time that the Armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh .
This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit–filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant . Since 1900 , Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa , Asia , Oceania and Latin America . That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion . Much of the growth has occurred after World War II , when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred . According to one source , Protestants constituted respectively 2.5 % , 2 % , 0.5 % of Latin Americans , Africans and Asians . In 2000 , percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17 % , more than 27 % and 5.5 % , respectively . According to Mark A. Noll , 79 % of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910 , while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth . By 2010 , 59 % of Anglicans were found in Africa . In 2010 , more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany , while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined . Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe . China is home to world 's largest Protestant minority . [ af ]
New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
Eisenhower 's main goals in office were to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits . In the first year of his presidency , he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in an effort to conclude the Korean War ; his New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing funding for conventional military forces . He ordered coups in Iran and Guatemala . Eisenhower refused to give major aid to help France in Vietnam . He gave strong financial support to the new nation of South Vietnam . Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution , which obliged the U.S. to militarily support the pro-Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the isolation of the People 's Republic of China .
In 2008 renewable energy accounted for 8 % of the country 's total energy consumption , a rise from the 7.2 % it accounted for in 2006 , but still below the EU average of 10 % in 2008 . 10 % of the country 's renewable energy comes from solar power , while most comes from biomass and waste recycling . In line with the European Commission 's Directive on Renewable Energy , Greece aims to get 18 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 . In 2013 and for several months , Greece produced more than 20 % of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants . Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation , however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin .
Although the Adventist churches hold much in common , their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness , whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment , the nature of immortality , whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium , and whether the sanctuary of Daniel 8 refers to the one in heaven or one on earth . The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible , leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath . The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church 's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs ( 1980 and 2005 ) , which use Biblical references as justification .
Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the New World , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Siberia , as well as all of Australia , until the European Age of Discovery . They still persist in some tribal societies , albeit in rapid decline . Peoples that preserved paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous peoples of the Amazonas ( Aché ) , some Central and Southern African ( San people ) , some peoples of New Guinea ( Fayu ) , the Mlabri of Thailand and Laos , the Vedda people of Sri Lanka , and a handful of uncontacted peoples . In Africa , the only remaining full-time hunter-gatherers are the Hadza of Tanzania . [ citation needed ]
Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra , composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran . Zarathustra 's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda ( God in the form of supreme wisdom ) . The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic divine God/Grand Architect of the universe tied with a unique eschatology and ethical system implying that each person is held morally responsible for their choices , made freely in this present life , in the afterlife . The importance placed on thought , action , responsibility , and a non-intervening creator was appealed to by , and inspired a number of , Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu .
The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world . Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music . In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States , the so-called " kef " style Armenian dance music , using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments ( often electrified/amplified ) and some western instruments , was popular . This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated . Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional " kef " style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of " kef music " heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time . Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia . Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry . Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan . Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star Cher . Ruben Hakobyan ( Ruben Sasuntsi ) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent . In the Armenian diaspora , Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . [ citation needed ] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes .
In 1797 , Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames , to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo . The idea of a police , as it then existed in France , was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import . In building the case for the police in the face of England 's firm anti-police sentiment , Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was " perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution . " Moreover , he went so far as to praise the French system , which had reached " the greatest degree of perfection " in his estimation .
Rome offers no native creation myth , and little mythography to explain the character of its deities , their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world , but Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales ( immortal gods ) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth . There were gods of the upper heavens , gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between . Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them , but none were intrinsically , irredeemably foreign or alien . The political , cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad , inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults . At different times and in different places , the sphere of influence , character and functions of a divine being could expand , overlap with those of others , and be redefined as Roman . Change was embedded within existing traditions .
The fairs held at the shrines of Sufi saints are called urs . They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint . On these occasions devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint . Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy . The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing . It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages . The most important urs are : urs of Data Ganj Buksh at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Sultan Bahu at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Shah Jewna at Jhang , urs of Hazrat Mian Mir at Lahore , urs of Baba Farid Ganj Shakar at Pakpattan , urs of Hazrat Bahaudin Zakria at Multan , urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at Dera Ghazi Khan , urs of Shah Hussain at Lahore , urs of Hazrat Bulleh Shah at Kasur , urs of Hazrat Imam Bari ( Bari Shah Latif ) at Rawalpindi-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayar Qadri ( the murrshad of Bulleh Shah ) in Lahore .
With high cost of labor in developed countries , production automation has become increasingly popular . Rather than being assembled by hand , mosaics designed using computer aided design ( CAD ) software can be assembled by a robot . Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy . But these " computer " mosaics have a different look than hand-made " artisanal " mosaics . With robotic production , colored tiles are loaded into buffers , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software .
The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks . The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets , saints and patriarchs . Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an Emperor kneeling before Christ ( late 9th or early 10th century ) . Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine . Justinian I is offering the model of the church to Mary while Constantine is holding a model of the city in his hand . Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded . A mosaic panel on the gallery shows Christ with Constantine Monomachos and Empress Zoe ( 1042–1055 ) . The emperor gives a bulging money sack to Christ as a donation for the church .
Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point , often two or three packs a day . Eisenhower stated that he " gave [ himself ] an order " to stop cold turkey in March 1949 while at Columbia . He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office . On September 24 , 1955 , while vacationing in Colorado , he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks ' hospitalization , during which time Nixon , Dulles , and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President . He was treated by Dr. Paul Dudley White , a cardiologist with a national reputation , who regularly informed the press of the President 's progress . Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President , his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery .
The Flushing Remonstrance shows support for separation of church and state as early as the mid-17th century , stating their opposition to religious persecution of any sort : " The law of love , peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews , Turks and Egyptians , as they are considered sons of Adam , which is the glory of the outward state of Holland , so love , peace and liberty , extending to all in Christ Jesus , condemns hatred , war and bondage . " The document was signed December 27 , 1657 by a group of English citizens in America who were affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of the Governor of New Netherland , Peter Stuyvesant . Stuyvesant had formally banned all religions other than the Dutch Reformed Church from being practiced in the colony , in accordance with the laws of the Dutch Republic . The signers indicated their " desire therefore in this case not to judge lest we be judged , neither to condemn least we be condemned , but rather let every man stand or fall to his own Master . " Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison until they recanted . However , John Bowne allowed the Quakers to meet in his home . Bowne was arrested , jailed , and sent to the Netherlands for trial ; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne .
Dwight David " Ike " Eisenhower ( /ˈaɪzənˌhaʊ.ər/ EYE-zən-HOW-ər ; October 14 , 1890 – March 28 , 1969 ) was an American politician and general who served as the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961 . He was a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe . He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942–43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45 from the Western Front . In 1951 , he became the first Supreme Commander of NATO .
By the end of the early modern period , the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context . Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging . The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture , and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state .
A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g . to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the University of Toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells ( defixiones ) , magical papyri and so-called " voodoo dolls " from a very early era . Around 250 defixiones have been recovered just from Roman Britain , in both urban and rural settings . Some seek straightforward , usually gruesome revenge , often for a lover 's offense or rejection . Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs , in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate , and promise a portion of the value ( usually small ) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration . None of these defixiones seem produced by , or on behalf of the elite , who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice . Similar traditions existed throughout the empire , persisting until around the 7th century AD , well into the Christian era .
Following the breakup of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of World War I for a brief period , from 1918 to 1920 , Armenia was an independent republic . In late 1920 , the communists came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the Red Army , and in 1922 , Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR of the Soviet Union , later forming the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ( 1936 to September 21 , 1991 ) . In 1991 , Armenia declared independence from the USSR and established the second Republic of Armenia .
The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . However , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] However , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] In some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . Hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . Some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced : some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred . Others complied . Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian , but powerful and influential ; and some provincial authorities were lenient , notably the Caesar in Gaul , Constantius Chlorus , the father of Constantine I. Diocletian 's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311 , when he asked Christians to pray for him . " This meant an ofﬁcial recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire , although one of the tetrarchs , Maximinus Daia , still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313 .

During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions . Of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent , the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula . India continued to collide with Asia . The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma ( ICS 2004 ) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene .
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8.2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19.9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity .
Armenians have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over four thousand years , since the time when Hayk , the legendary patriarch and founder of the first Armenian nation , led them to victory over Bel of Babylon . Today , with a population of 3.5 million , they not only constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia , but also in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh . Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as Hayastantsis ( Հայաստանցի ) , meaning those that are from Armenia ( that is , those born and raised in Armenia ) . They , as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language . The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination , but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian .
The Plymouth Brethren are a conservative , low church , evangelical movement , whose history can be traced to Dublin , Ireland , in the late 1820s , originating from Anglicanism . Among other beliefs , the group emphasizes sola scriptura . Brethren generally see themselves not as a denomination , but as a network , or even as a collection of overlapping networks , of like-minded independent churches . Although the group refused for many years to take any denominational name to itself—a stance that some of them still maintain—the title The Brethren , is one that many of their number are comfortable with in that the Bible designates all believers as brethren .
Baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah 's Witnesses . Jehovah 's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism , and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid . Individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them " as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses in association with God 's spirit-directed organization , " though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not " to a man , work or organization . " Their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to " his organization , " [ note 2 ] stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive God 's favor and to survive Armageddon .
During the feudal and colonial times in British India , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharajas and nawabs , as well as British officers , maintained a whole corps of shikaris ( big-game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . They would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir-shikar . Often , they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . Big game , such as Bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .
Since June 2007 , YouTube 's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products . This required YouTube 's content to be transcoded into Apple 's preferred video standard , H.264 , a process that took several months . YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV , iPod Touch and the iPhone . In July 2010 , the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 , avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls . The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform . In September 2012 , YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone , following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system . According to GlobalWebIndex , YouTube was used by 35 % of smartphone users between April and June 2013 , making it the third most used app .
The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge , also known as the 'President JK Bridge ' or the 'JK Bridge ' , crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasília . It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira , former president of Brazil . It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde . Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to " ... outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment , aesthetic merit and successful community participation " .
The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City—Pelham Bay Park , which includes Orchard Beach—and the fourth largest , Van Cortlandt Park , which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders Yonkers . Also in the northern Bronx , Wave Hill , the former estate of George W. Perkins—known for a historic house , gardens , changing site-specific art installations and concerts—overlooks the New Jersey Palisades from a promontory on the Hudson in Riverdale . Nearer the borough 's center , and along the Bronx River , is Bronx Park ; its northern end houses the New York Botanical Gardens , which preserve the last patch of the original hemlock forest that once covered the entire county , and its southern end the Bronx Zoo , the largest urban zoological gardens in the United States . Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the Jerome Park Reservoir , surrounded by 2 miles ( 3 km ) of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood ; the reservoir was built in the 1890s on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack . Further south is Crotona Park , home to a 3.3-acre ( 1.3 ha ) lake , 28 species of trees , and a large swimming pool . The land for these parks , and many others , was bought by New York City in 1888 , while land was still open and inexpensive , in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development .
There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . In part , these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection . Thus , while there still is no cure for AIDS , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer coined the term Humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in German secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the English language in this sense . The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when German historian and philologist Georg Voigt used humanism to describe Renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the Italian Renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially Italy .
In February 2015 , YouTube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called YouTube Kids . It allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both Android and iOS devices . Later on August 26 , 2015 , YouTube Gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with Twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
During the same court battle , Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site . The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which called the court ruling " a setback to privacy rights " . In June 2010 , Viacom 's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment , with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling .
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women , including many Armenian families . Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region , referred to as Artsakh ( see also Karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of Banants ( near Gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . The first time that the Armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh .
The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age , in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long , stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician . The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought ; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years . The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( from 7000ppm to 4400ppm ) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived . As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole , ice caps formed on it . Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America , which were south-polar locations at the time .
That evening , Eisenhower 's body was placed onto a train en route to Abilene , Kansas , the last time a funeral train has been used as part of funeral proceedings of an American president . His body arrived on April 2 , and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library . The president 's body was buried as a General of the Army . The family used an $ 80 standard soldier 's casket , and dressed Eisenhower 's body in his famous short green jacket . His only medals worn were : the Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters , the Navy Distinguished Service Medal , and the Legion of Merit . Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud , who died at age 3 in 1921 . His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979 .
In the Iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the Hagia Irene in Constantinople ( after 740 ) . There were similar crosses in the apses of the Hagia Sophia Church in Thessaloniki and in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea . The crosses were substituted with the image of the Theotokos in both churches after the victory of the Iconodules ( 787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively , the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
In 1948 , Eisenhower became President of Columbia University , an Ivy League university in New York City . The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction . During that year Eisenhower 's memoir , Crusade in Europe , was published . Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs , and it was a major financial success as well . Eisenhower 's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer , but rather , marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences , and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $ 635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate . This ruling saved Eisenhower about $ 400,000 .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]

In the 1960 election to choose his successor , Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President , Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F. Kennedy . He told friends , " I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy . " He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days , although he may have done Nixon some harm . When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon 's policy ideas he had adopted , Eisenhower joked , " If you give me a week , I might think of one . I do n't remember . " Kennedy 's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials . Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy . Eisenhower , who was the oldest president in history at that time ( then 70 ) , was succeeded by the youngest elected president , as Kennedy was 43 .
In January 2010 , YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard . This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed . The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial . Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the H.264 or WebM formats could play the videos , and not all videos on the site were available .
The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world . In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state , while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay . In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town , while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world , and may provide university accommodation for their students .
At the time , there were many varying opinions about Christian doctrine , and no centralized way of enforcing orthodoxy . Constantine called all the Christian bishops throughout the Roman Empire to a meeting , and some 318 bishops ( very few from the Western Empire ) attended the First Council of Nicaea . The purpose of this meeting was to define Christian orthodoxy and clearly differentiate it from Christian heresies . The meeting reached consensus on the Nicene Creed and other statements . Later , Philostorgius criticized Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus Constantine . Constantine nevertheless took great pains to assuage traditionalist and Christian anxieties .
Edwin Chadwick 's 1829 article , " Preventive police " in the London Review , argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body , which was not the case in practice . The reason , argued Chadwick , was that " A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation . " In contrast to a deterrent of punishment , a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - " crime does n't pay " . In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act , the " object " of the new Metropolitan Police , was changed by Robert Peel to the " principal object , " which was the " prevention of crime . " Later historians would attribute the perception of England 's " appearance of orderliness and love of public order " to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel 's police system .
Antarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap . Mountain building in western North America continued , and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African plate continued to push north into the Eurasian plate , isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea . A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe . There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar . During the Oligocene , South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America . It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow , rapidly cooling the continent .
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy ( the Latin kings of Alba Longa ) with the well-known legend of Rome 's founding by Romulus and Remus . The most common version of the twins ' story displays several aspects of hero myth . Their mother , Rhea Silvia , had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin , in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father . Through divine intervention , the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars . She gave birth to twins , who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events .
In addition , the minority leader has a number of other institutional functions . For instance , the minority leader is sometimes statutorily authorized to appoint individuals to certain federal entities ; he or she and the majority leader each name three Members to serve as Private Calendar objectors ; he or she is consulted with respect to reconvening the House per the usual formulation of conditional concurrent adjournment resolutions ; he or she is a traditional member of the House Office Building Commission ; he or she is a member of the United States Capitol Preservation Commission ; and he or she may , after consultation with the Speaker , convene an early organizational party caucus or conference . Informally , the minority leader maintains ties with majority party leaders to learn about the schedule and other House matters and forges agreements or understandings with them insofar as feasible .
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
Sacrifice to deities of the heavens ( di superi , " gods above " ) was performed in daylight , and under the public gaze . Deities of the upper heavens required white , infertile victims of their own sex : Juno a white heifer ( possibly a white cow ) ; Jupiter a white , castrated ox ( bos mas ) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls . Di superi with strong connections to the earth , such as Mars , Janus , Neptune and various genii – including the Emperor 's – were offered fertile victims . After the sacrifice , a banquet was held ; in state cults , the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion ( exta , the innards ) . Rome 's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat ; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own .
In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the Spirit . Generally , however , Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as Word of Faith , Toronto Blessing , Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival . Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the USA , in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is Terry Virgo .
A Vestal 's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women , with elements of both virgin bride and daughter , and Roman matron and wife . Unlike male priests , Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children , and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced : a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive . Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social ; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties , which were considered essential to the security of Rome .
In 2014 YouTube said that 300 hours of new videos were uploaded to the site every minute , three times more than one year earlier and that around three quarters of the material comes from outside the U.S . The site has 800 million unique users a month . It is estimated that in 2007 YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000 . According to third-party web analytics providers , Alexa and SimilarWeb , YouTube is the third most visited website in the world , as of June 2015 ; SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website globally , attracting more than 15 billion visitors per month .
The centrality of the " separation " concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U.S. 1 ( 1947 ) , a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools . This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state , having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature . Citing Jefferson , the court concluded that " The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . "
The Government of Punjab is a provincial government in the federal structure of Pakistan , is based in Lahore , the capital of the Punjab Province . The Chief Minister of Punjab ( CM ) is elected by the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to serve as the head of the provincial government in Punjab , Pakistan . The current Chief Minister is Shahbaz Sharif , who became the Chief Minister of Punjab as being restored after Governor 's rule starting from 25 February 2009 to 30 March 2009 . Thereafter got re-elected as a result of 11 May 2013 elections . The Provincial Assembly of the Punjab is a unicameral legislature of elected representatives of the province of Punjab , which is located in Lahore in eastern Pakistan . The Assembly was established under Article 106 of the Constitution of Pakistan as having a total of 371 seats , with 66 seats reserved for women and eight reserved for non-Muslims .
Greece attracts more than 16 million tourists each year , thus contributing 18.2 % to the nation 's GDP in 2008 according to an OECD report . The same survey showed that the average tourist expenditure while in Greece was $ 1,073 , ranking Greece 10th in the world . The number of jobs directly or indirectly related to the tourism sector were 840,000 in 2008 and represented 19 % of the country 's total labor force . In 2009 , Greece welcomed over 19.3 million tourists , a major increase from the 17.7 million tourists the country welcomed in 2008 .
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the kingly . Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting . One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mriga means deer ; vyadha means hunter ) . The word Mriga , in many Indian languages including Malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( Mriga Thrishna ) . Shiva , as Mrigavyadha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . In the epic Ramayana , Dasharatha , the father of Rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . During one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed Shravana , mistaking him for game . During Rama 's exile in the forest , Ravana kidnapped his wife , Sita , from their hut , while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer , and his brother Lakshman went after him . According to the Mahabharat , Pandu , the father of the Pandavas , accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow , mistaking them for a deer . Krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior . Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area . This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission . It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates . Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate . There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load , making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism , which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections . There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load . Thus , polygny may also be due to a lower male : female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases . Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .
Raymond B. Bragg , the associate editor of The New Humanist , sought to consolidate the input of Leon Milton Birkhead , Charles Francis Potter , and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference . Bragg asked Roy Wood Sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 . Potter 's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism , the latter declaring a new religion by saying , " any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age . To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present . " It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion .
Since the late 1980s , significant development has occurred in the Bronx , first stimulated by the city 's " Ten-Year Housing Plan " and community members working to rebuild the social , economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing . Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units . The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos ' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx . The IRT White Plains Road Line ( 2 5 trains ) began to show an increase in riders . Chains such as Marshalls , Staples , and Target opened stores in the Bronx . More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole ( rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007 ) , although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods , while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs .
Throughout his presidency , Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism . A self-described " progressive conservative , " he continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation , especially Social Security . He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers . He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years , which had not been completed under Truman .
The mosaics of St. Peter 's often show lively Baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like Ciro Ferri , Guido Reni , Domenichino , Carlo Maratta , and many others . Raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting , the Transfiguration . Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter 's , including Giovanni Battista Calandra , Fabio Cristofari ( died 1689 ) , and Pietro Paolo Cristofari ( died 1743 ) . Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts .
They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message .
Hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . Tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
The main international airport serving Kathmandu and thus Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport , located about six kilometers ( 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) ) from the city centre . Operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal it has two terminals , one domestic and one international . At present , about 22 international airlines connect Nepal to other destinations in Europe , Asia and the Middle East , to cities such as Istanbul , Delhi , Kolkata , Singapore , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , Dhaka , Islamabad , Paro , Lhasa , Chengdu , and Guangzhou . A recent extension to the international terminal has made the distance to the airplanes shorter and in October 2009 it became possible to fly directly to Kathmandu from Amsterdam with Arkefly . Since 2013 , Turkish Airlines connects Istanbul to Kathmandu . Regionally , several Nepali airlines operate from the city , including Agni Air , Buddha Air , Cosmic Air , Nepal Airlines and Yeti Airlines , to other major towns across Nepal .
The colophons of ancient manuscripts , dated as late as the 20th century , refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala . Mahanagar means " great city " . The city is called " Kasthamandap " in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day . Thus , Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap . During medieval times , the city was sometimes called Kantipur ( कान्तिपुर ) . This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur . " Kanti " is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi , and " pur " means place .
Kathmandu valley is described as " an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures " , which are made of wood , stone , metal , and terracotta , and found in profusion in temples , shrines , stupas , gompas , chaityasm and palaces . The art objects are also seen in street corners , lanes , private courtyards and in open ground . Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses . Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time , but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950 .
The impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of Rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion . In this spirit , a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio , in the sense of " doing or believing more than was necessary " , to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone . The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite . The famous tirade of Lucretius , the Epicurean rationalist , against what is usually translated as " superstition " was in fact aimed at excessive religio . Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith , but superstitio was viewed as an " inappropriate desire for knowledge " ; in effect , an abuse of religio .
On 16 March 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act , which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen . The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest . They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge System . [ citation needed ] In addition to waterfowl , it is estimated that one third of the nation 's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds . [ citation needed ]
Protestants have founded hospitals , homes for disabled or elderly people , educational institutions , organizations that give aid to developing countries , and other social welfare agencies . In the nineteenth century , throughout the Anglo-American world , numerous dedicated members of all Protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery , prison reforms , and woman suffrage . As an answer to the " social question " of the nineteenth century , Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state ( health insurance , accident insurance , disability insurance , old-age pensions ) . To Bismarck this was " practical Christianity " . These programs , too , were copied by many other nations , particularly in the Western world .
In 1997 , the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League , acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century . In 2006 , The New York Times reported that " construction cranes have become the borough 's new visual metaphor , replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings . " The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002 . Between 2002 and June 2007 , 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $ 4.8 billion has been invested in new housing . In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $ 965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed . Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx .
A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos . In January 2009 , YouTube launched " YouTube for TV " , a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers , initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles . In June 2009 , YouTube XL was introduced , which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen . YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live . On November 15 , 2012 , Google launched an official app for the Wii , allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel . An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5 . Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17 , 2013 and in October 2014 , the Sony PlayStation 4 .
Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the St Mark 's Basilica in Venice ( mainly from the 17th–19th centuries , but the oldest one from 1270–75 , " The burial of St Mark in the first basilica " ) , the Cathedral of Orvieto ( golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century , many times redone ) and the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca ( huge , striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below , designed by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri in the 13th century ) . The Cathedral of Spoleto is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the Blessing Christ ( signed by one Solsternus from 1207 ) .
In 2003 , the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania . The panels depict real or fantastic animal , floral , solar and geometric representations . Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church , built some time between the 10th and 11th century . Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence . The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary .
All YouTube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration . Users who have a good track record of complying with the site 's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length , which requires verifying the account , normally through a mobile phone . When YouTube was launched in 2005 , it was possible to upload long videos , but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films . The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010 . If an up-to-date browser version is used , videos greater than 20 GB can be uploaded .
In the 19th century , southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . The rest of the animal was typically discarded . Some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . In Nordic countries , hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon . Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa , India and other places in pursuit of trophies . In modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
The Boudhanath , ( also written Bouddhanath , Bodhnath , Baudhanath or the Khāsa Chaitya ) , is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal , along with Swayambhu . It is a very popular tourist site . Boudhanath is known as Khāsti by Newars and as Bauddha or Bodhnāth by speakers of Nepali . Located about 11 km ( 7 mi ) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu , the stupa 's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal . Boudhanath became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 .
Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God 's kingdom in October 1914 , and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . They believe that Jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word parousia—usually translated as " coming " when referring to Christ—as " presence " . They believe Jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the " second coming " of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome , gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the Early Middle Ages . 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore . The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period . Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings . In the apse mosaic of Sant'Agata dei Goti ( 462–472 , destroyed in 1589 ) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him , six on either side . At Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara ( 468–483 , destroyed in 1686 ) Christ appeared in the center , flanked on either side by three Apostles . Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ . The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the Santa Sabina was replaced by a very similar fresco by Taddeo Zuccari in 1559 . The composition probably remained unchanged : Christ flanked by male and female saints , seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet . All three mosaics had a similar iconography .
The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists , and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks , and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side . According to the Nepali Hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation . The chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .
There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . Evangelicalism is a prominent example . Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism , some are Christian-wide . Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Roman Catholic Church , such as does it the Charismatic Movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity . Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement . Nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
The name Anabaptist , meaning " one who baptizes again " , was given them by their persecutors in reference to the practice of re-baptizing converts who already had been baptized as infants . Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants . The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist , claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void , the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism . As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues , Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics . [ aa ] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount , which precluded taking oaths , participating in military actions , and participating in civil government , some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise . [ ab ] They were thus technically Anabaptists , even though conservative Amish , Mennonites , and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism . Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are diveded into Radical and the so-called Second Front . Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden , Thomas Müntzer , Kaspar Schwenkfeld , Sebastian Franck , Menno Simons . Second Front Reformers included Hans Denck , Conrad Grebel , Balthasar Hubmaier and Felix Manz .
The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society . In the middle Republican era , even Scipio 's tentative hints that he might be Jupiter 's special protege sat ill with his colleagues . Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal ; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus . Julius Caesar went further , and claimed her as his ancestress . Such claims suggested personal character and policy as divinely inspired ; an appointment to priesthood offered divine validation . In 63 BC , Julius Caesar 's appointment as pontifex maximus " signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics " . Likewise , political candidates could sponsor temples , priesthoods and the immensely popular , spectacular public ludi and munera whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic . Under the principate , such opportunities were limited by law ; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps ( " first citizen " ) .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " The Fourth Council of the Lateran , held under Pope Innocent III , decreed ( canon xv ) : " We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " The decree of the Council of Trent is worded more mildly : " Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( Sess . XXIV , De reform. , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
The Portuguese language is the official national language and the primary language taught in schools . English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum . The city has six international schools : American School of Brasília , Brasília International School ( BIS ) , Escola das Nações , Swiss International School ( SIS ) , Lycée français François-Mitterrand ( LfFM ) and Maple Bear Canadian School . August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school - The British School of Brasilia . Brasília has two universities , three university centers , and many private colleges .
The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as : Bhavani , Durga , Gaja-Lakshmi , Hariti-Sitala , Mahsishamardini , Saptamatrika ( seven mother goddesses ) , and Sri-Lakshmi ( wealth-goddess ) . From the 3rd century BC , apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses , Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period ( it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC ) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular . These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution : the Licchavi or classical period ( 500 to 900 AD ) , the post-classical period ( 1000 to 1400 AD ) , with strong influence of the Palla art form ; the Malla period ( 1400 onwards ) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology .
With the initial investment of £4,200 , the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades , of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and " on the game . " The force was a success after its first year , and his men had " established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives . " Word of this success spread quickly , and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800 , transforming it from a private to public police agency ; now the oldest police force in the world . Colquhoun published a book on the experiment , The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames . It found receptive audiences far outside London , and inspired similar forces in other cities , notably , New York City , Dublin , and Sydney .
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature . All of the characters in Herman Wouk 's City Boy : The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder ( 1948 ) live in the Bronx , and about half of the action is set there . Kate Simon 's Bronx Primitive : Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical , a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II , and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue . In Jacob M. Appel 's short story , " The Grand Concourse " ( 2007 ) , a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter . Similarly , in Avery Corman 's book The Old Neighborhood ( 1980 ) , an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ( Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse ) , and learns that even though the folks are poor , Hispanic and African-American , they are good people .
Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . The most important is the so-called " Armenian Mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate . It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . Populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . The inscription reads : " For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows . " Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
In Europe , there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism . The Enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secularism . Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism , attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant countries . In North America , South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe . United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries . South America , historically Roman Catholic , has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries .
The heyday of mosaic making in Sicily was the age of the independent Norman kingdom in the 12th century . The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule . Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style , that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies . Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the Cappella Palatina of Roger II , the Martorana church in Palermo and the cathedrals of Cefalù and Monreale .
Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer , so it is difficult to make generalizations , but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature ( Alain , 2001 ) . Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) . James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies ' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic . He argues that transnational police information circuits help to " compose the panic scenes of the security-control society " . The paradoxical effect is that , the harder policing agencies work to produce security , the greater are feelings of insecurity .
Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken . A notable exception is James Sheptycki 's study of police cooperation in the English Channel region ( 2002 ) , which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case-work . The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned . By 1992 , with the signing of the Schengen Treaty , which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union , there were worries that much , if not all , of this intelligence sharing was opaque , raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe ( Joubert and Bevers , 1996 ) .
Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx ; in addition , a La Quinta Inn that has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront . The Kingsbridge Armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center . Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the New York City Subway 's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College . The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost US $ 350–500 million .
In Rome , state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional . As princeps ( first citizen ) he must respect traditional Republican mores ; given virtually monarchic powers , he must restrain them . He was not a living divus but father of his country ( pater patriae ) , its pontifex maximus ( greatest priest ) and at least notionally , its leading Republican . When he died , his ascent to heaven , or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate . As a divus , he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine , garlands , incense , hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals . What he did in return for these favours is unknown , but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor . In Rome , official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius ; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that . In the crises leading up to the Dominate , Imperial titles and honours multiplied , reaching a peak under Diocletian . Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being ; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous .
Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials . They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas , once common in the Eastern Mediterranean . The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham 's Palace , Palestine which was made around 744 . The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer ( right side ) and two deers peacefully grazing ( left side ) . The panel probably represents good and bad governance . Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar , Lebanon . The luxurious desert residence of Al-Walid II in Qasr al-Hallabat ( in present-day Jordan ) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill . The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by " good " animals on one side and " bad " animals on the other . Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls , grapes , pomegranates , oryx , wolves , hares , a leopard , pairs of partridges , fish , bulls , ostriches , rabbits , rams , goats , lions and a snake . At Qastal , near Amman , excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day Jordan , dating probably from the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ( 685–705 ) . They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor . The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns , trees , animals , fruits and rosettes . Except for the open courtyard , entrance and staircases , the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics .
Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science . In fact , more than 80 % of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained , of which approximately 45 % held university posts . It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable , and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development . There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system , which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world . However , university professors still utilized some autonomy , at least in the sciences , to choose epistemological foundations and methods . For instance , Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction . Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities , and the debates surrounding that adoption , which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change . There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities . Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged , when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability , and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources .

In addition to the above , Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea , as well as the Libyan Sea , within the Greek exclusive economic zone , south of Crete . The Ministry of the Environment , Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries ( including Norway and the United States ) in exploration , and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012 . In November 2012 , a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion .
Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . Robert Blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a " spy-plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . As a result , the Eisenhower Administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over Turkey . The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
There are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches , and are far smaller in membership . Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as " Christians " or " born-again Christians " . They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communities by calling themselves " non-denominational " or " evangelical " . Often founded by individual pastors , they have little affiliation with historic denominations .
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
Punjab ( Urdu , Punjabi : پنجاب , panj-āb , " five waters " : listen ( help·info ) ) , also spelled Panjab , is the most populous of the four provinces of Pakistan . It has an area of 205,344 square kilometres ( 79,284 square miles ) and a population of 91.379.615 in 2011 , approximately 56 % of the country 's total population . Its provincial capital and largest city is Lahore . Punjab is bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast and Punjab and Rajasthan to the east . In Pakistan it is bordered by Sindh to the south , Balochistān and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west , and Islamabad and Azad Kashmir to the north .
The Eisenhowers had two sons . Doud Dwight " Icky " Eisenhower was born September 24 , 1917 , and died of scarlet fever on January 2 , 1921 , at the age of three ; Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death . Their second son , John Eisenhower ( 1922–2013 ) , was born in Denver Colorado . John served in the United States Army , retired as a brigadier general , became an author and served as U.S . Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971 . Coincidentally , John graduated from West Point on D-Day , June 6 , 1944 . He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10 , 1947 . John and Barbara had four children : David , Barbara Ann , Susan Elaine and Mary Jean . David , after whom Camp David is named , married Richard Nixon 's daughter Julie in 1968 . John died on December 21 , 2013 .
The Crusaders in the Holy Land also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence . During their 12th-century reconstruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones . Almost nothing of them survived except the " Ascension of Christ " in the Latin Chapel ( now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics ) . More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem . The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ , Councils of the Church and angels . In the apses the Annunciation , the Nativity , Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen . The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor , the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church .
Law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . In some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . The police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly . In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts , cutaneous abscesses , respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent . Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent , the presence of a microbe in a community , and other epidemiological considerations . Given sufficient effort , all known infectious agents can be specifically identified . The benefits of identification , however , are often greatly outweighed by the cost , as often there is no specific treatment , the cause is obvious , or the outcome of an infection is benign .
The D-Day Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 , were costly but successful . A month later , the invasion of Southern France took place , and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF . Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer 's end—however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year . From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8 , 1945 , Eisenhower , through SHAEF , commanded all Allied forces , and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps . He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families . This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion . Eisenhower 's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed . It has been called one of the great speeches of history :
Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms . Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs . When present , however , these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body . A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone . The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived , non-lethal infection . Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another Herrerasaurus . Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include Acrocanthosaurus , Allosaurus , Tyrannosaurus and a tyrannosaur from the Kirtland Formation . The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
From early Christian times , hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics . Thus the Corpus Juris Canonici ( C. ii , X , De cleric . venat . ) says , " We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons .

New Zealand has a strong hunting culture . The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . However , once Europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . Deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the New Zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
As a consequence , there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece 's ability to repay its sovereign debt , as reflected by the rise of the country 's borrowing rates ( although their slow rise – the 10-year government bond yield only exceeded 7 % in April 2010 – coinciding with a large number of negative articles , has led to arguments about the role of international news media in the evolution of the crisis ) . In order to avert a default ( as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets ) , in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries , and the IMF , agreed to a " rescue package " which involved giving Greece an immediate €45 billion in bail-out loans , with more funds to follow , totaling €110 billion . In order to secure the funding , Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control . Their implementation will be monitored and evaluated by the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF .
In late 1954 , Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to " Free Vietnam " ( the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955 ) , effectively elevating the country to sovereign status . Collins ' instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism , by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign . In February 1955 , Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem 's army . After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , commonly known as South Vietnam ) in October , Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military , economic , and technical assistance .
During the Cretaceous , the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . As the Atlantic Ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera , as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies . Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous , Gondwana itself broke up as South America , Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa ( though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed . Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
In the mid-fifteenth century , the religion of Sikhism was born . During the Mughal empire , many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism . These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire . After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century , the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh , which lasted from 1799 to 1849 . The capital of Ranjit Singh 's empire was Lahore , and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir . Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab . Syed Ahmad Barelvi a Muslim , waged jihad and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law . Syed Ahmad Barelvi in 1821 with many supporters and spent two years organising popular and material support for his Punjab campaign . He carefully developed a network of people through the length and breadth of India to collect funds and encourage volunteers , travelling widely throughout India attracting a following among pious Muslims . In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora Khattak , but with no decisive result . In a major battle near the town of Balakot in 1831 , Sayyid Ahmad and Shah Ismail Shaheed with volunteer Muslims were defeated by the professional Sikh Army .
The Abbot of Monte Cassino , Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church . According to chronicler Leo of Ostia the Greek artists decorated the apse , the arch and the vestibule of the basilica . Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds ( now in the Monte Cassino Museum ) . " The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts " – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy .
Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within , and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion . Their beliefs , however , were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands ( and later to New England ) , and by evangelical clergy to Ireland ( and later into Wales ) , and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system , particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge . They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system , particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops . They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century , and were influenced by millennialism .
In the years that followed , Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men . This was due to North Vietnam 's support of " uprisings " in the south and concern the nation would fall . In May 1957 Diem , then President of South Vietnam , made a state visit to the United States for ten days . President Eisenhower pledged his continued support , and a parade was held in Diem 's honor in New York City . Although Diem was publicly praised , in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives .
Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals .
Most videos enable users to leave comments , and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content . In 2006 , Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling " community and collaboration on a scale never seen before " , and added that YouTube " harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom . Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone , never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred " . The Guardian in 2009 described users ' comments on YouTube as :
Following the German unconditional surrender , Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U.S . Occupation Zone , based at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main . He had no responsibility for the other three zones , controlled by Britain , France and the Soviet Union , except for the city of Berlin , which was managed by the Four-Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body . Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps , he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials . He reclassified German prisoners of war ( POWs ) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces ( DEFs ) , who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention . Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) in directive JCS 1067 , but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization . In response to the devastation in Germany , including food shortages and an influx of refugees , he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment . His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains , while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis .
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding Archean . In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean , the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the Proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . Roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia , began to break apart . The continents later recombined to form Pannotia , 600–540 Ma .
Many scholars ( including Makdisi ) have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus , the Emirate of Sicily , and the Middle East ( during the Crusades ) . Other scholars see this argument as overstated . Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education , turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context .
Hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . Some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . Hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
Protestantism is a form of Christian faith and practice which originated with the Protestant Reformation , [ a ] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church . It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom , together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy . Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism . [ b ] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical .
Armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . Arguably the favorite food is khorovats an Armenian-styled barbecue . Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread , and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . Also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture . Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet . Apricots ( Prunus armeniaca , also known as Armenian Plum ) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . Peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . Preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
In the everyday world , many individuals sought to divine the future , influence it through magic , or seek vengeance with help from " private " diviners . The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods , not foretelling the future . Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect . So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit , subversive or magical purposes . Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times , notably in 139 BC and 33 BC . In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death . " Egyptian rites " were particularly suspect : Augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect ; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19 . Despite several Imperial bans , magic and astrology persisted among all social classes . In the late 1st century AD , Tacitus observed that astrologers " would always be banned and always retained at Rome " .
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet . [ note 5 ] Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " .
The Bronx is named after Jonas Bronck who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639 . The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community , first from various European countries ( particularly Ireland , Germany and Italy ) and later from the Caribbean region ( particularly Puerto Rico , Jamaica and the Dominican Republic ) , as well as African American migrants from the American South . This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop .
The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome 's internal governance , diplomacy and development from kingdom , to Republic and to Empire . Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite : kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices . In the early Republic , as presumably in the regal era , plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office , and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge . They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office , public priesthood , and knowledge of civil and religious law . The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency ; he negotiated a settlement , and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia . The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public . Plebeian tribunes were appointed , with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate . In principle , the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians . In reality , the patrician and to a lesser extent , plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond .
While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters , the importance of this for the emergence of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines , including the production of stone tools and eventually the control of fire , are emphasised in the hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and social interaction , including mating behaviour , as essential in the emergence of human behavioural modernity . With the establishment of language , culture , and religion , hunting became a theme of stories and myths , as well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice .
World literature was enriched by the works of Edmund Spenser , John Milton , John Bunyan , John Donne , John Dryden , Daniel Defoe , William Wordsworth , Jonathan Swift , Johann Wolfgang Goethe , Friedrich Schiller , Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Edgar Allan Poe , Matthew Arnold , Conrad Ferdinand Meyer , Theodor Fontane , Washington Irving , Robert Browning , Emily Dickinson , Emily Brontë , Charles Dickens , Nathaniel Hawthorne , Thomas Stearns Eliot , John Galsworthy , Thomas Mann , William Faulkner , John Updike , and many others .
The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century ( a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution ) has been little researched . Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy , calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations . Industrial activity , ( including heavy industry like shipbuilding ) was evident , mainly in Ermoupolis and Piraeus . Nonetheless , Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826 , 1843 , 1860 and 1894 .
A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds . In Tanzania , it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist . While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation , the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps . Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas , uninviting to the typical ecotourist . Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities . [ citation needed ]
Greece is a developed country with an economy based on the service ( 82.8 % ) and industrial sectors ( 13.3 % ) . The agricultural sector contributed 3.9 % of national economic output in 2015 . Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping . With 18 million international tourists in 2013 , Greece was the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world . The Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world , with Greek-owned vessels accounting for 15 % of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013 . The increased demand for international maritime transportation between Greece and Asia has resulted in unprecedented investment in the shipping industry .
^Note 5 : The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church , but until 1835 the NC Constitution allowed only Protestants to hold public office . From 1835-1876 it allowed only Christians ( including Catholics ) to hold public office . Article VI , Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding public office . Such clauses were held by the United States Supreme Court to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v. Watkins , when the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with First and Fourteenth Amendment protections .
The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower 's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency . Meanwhile , Columbia University 's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president 's ties to oilmen and businessmen , including Leonard McCollum , the president of Continental Oil ; Frank Abrams , the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey ; Bob Kleberg , the president of the King Ranch ; H. J. Porter , a Texas oil executive ; Bob Woodruff , the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation ; and Clarence Francis , the chairman of General Foods .
Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius , the doomed son of Pompey the Great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . Erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions " . She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . A female foreigner from Thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature , along with Horace 's Canidia .
After golf , oil painting was Eisenhower 's second hobby . While at Columbia University , Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie 's portrait . Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax , mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie , their grandchildren , General Montgomery , George Washington , and Abraham Lincoln . Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower 's work , " simple and earnest , rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president " . A conservative in both art and politics , he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as " a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie , loaded with paint , has been driven over it . "
In the Middle Ages , the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related . Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . Luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in Scripture ; 1523 ) . Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to Calvin 's system of church self-government . This system was taken over by the other reformed churches .
Michel Foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in Public administration and Statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries , most notably with Nicolas Delamare 's Traité de la Police ( " Treatise on the Police " ) , first published in 1705 . The German Polizeiwissenschaft ( Science of Police ) first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk a 17th-century Austrian Political economist and civil servant and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police . Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften ( 1937 ) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however , this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault 's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850 .
The colophons of ancient manuscripts , dated as late as the 20th century , refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala . Mahanagar means " great city " . The city is called " Kasthamandap " in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day . Thus , Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap . During medieval times , the city was sometimes called Kantipur ( कान्तिपुर ) . This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur . " Kanti " is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi , and " pur " means place .
The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
In the 5th-century Ravenna , the capital of the Western Roman Empire , became the center of late Roman mosaic art . The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . The vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . Another great building established by Galla Placidia was the church of San Giovanni Evangelista . She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna . The mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna , Peter Chrysologus . They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
The Martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished . The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina , with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . The Greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina . The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily , dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the Theotokos with Georgios of Antiochia , the founder of the church .
In 1953 , the Republican Party 's Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch ; however , the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a practical moot point . At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted , unsuccessfully , to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials . Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower 's presidency .
There are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches , and are far smaller in membership . Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as " Christians " or " born-again Christians " . They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and/or creedalism of other Christian communities by calling themselves " non-denominational " or " evangelical " . Often founded by individual pastors , they have little affiliation with historic denominations .

In the Regal era , a rex sacrorum ( king of the sacred rites ) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king ( rex ) or in his absence , and announced the public festivals . He had little or no civil authority . With the abolition of monarchy , the collegial power and influence of the Republican pontifices increased . By the late Republican era , the flamines were supervised by the pontifical collegia . The rex sacrorum had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title : his religious duties still included the daily , ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential pontifex maximus .
Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions , many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx . The New York City Department of Education manages public noncharter schools in the borough . In 2000 , public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx 's residents over 3 years old ( out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools ) . There are also several public charter schools . Private schools range from élite independent schools to religiously affiliated schools run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Jewish organizations .

The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures ; in principle , Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin , Etruscan and other Italian peoples , cults and deities as Roman . Those who acknowledged Rome 's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars , independent of Roman religious law . Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis . Autonomy and concord were official policy , but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models . Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages , especially to local elites . All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia . By the middle of the 1st century AD , Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established , Romanised cult nearby : by the end of that century , Sabratha ’ s so-called tophet was no longer in use . Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome 's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice , not a centralised legal requirement . Major cult centres to " non-Roman " deities continued to prosper : notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium , the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo 's sacred wood at Antioch .
In most parts of medieval Europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the King 's deer " . In contrast , settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks . In epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals . Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs , the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub . Thus , infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated ( Figure 1 ) . However , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs . The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method . Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001 .
The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . Many wars , and especially the Thirty Years ' War , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times . War , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . Internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . As universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the University of Paris ) became more and more prominent . Although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . Control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church ’ s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
After 1517 , when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available , the Dutch humanist Erasmus , who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of Aldus Manutius , began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla , comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter . Erasmus , along with the French humanist Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples , began issuing new translations , laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation . Henceforth Renaissance humanism , particularly in the German North , became concerned with religion , while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists , studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith . After the Reformation , critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called Higher criticism of the 19th-century German Tübingen school .
The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election . Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson ( later U.S. president ) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House , both from Texas . Joe Martin , the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 , wrote that Eisenhower " never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill . There were exceptions , Leonard W. Hall , for example , who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the administration 's eyes to the political facts of life , with occasional success . However , these exceptions were not enough to right the balance . "
Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ) Alliance with the U.K. , France , New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism . At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks ; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer . After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam , Eisenhower rejected the agreement , offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam . Ambrose argues that Eisenhower , by not participating in the Geneva agreement , had kept the U.S out of Vietnam ; nevertheless , with the formation of SEATO , he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict .
They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message .
Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909 . As a freshman , he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin , and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening .

World War II ( 1939-1945 ) devastated the country 's economy , but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle . From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average , peaking at 5.8 % in 2003 and 5.7 % in 2006 . The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis , a central focus of the wider European debt crisis , plunged the economy into a sharp downturn , with real GDP growth rates of −0.3 % in 2008 , −4.3 % in 2009 , −5.5 % in 2010 , −9.1 % in 2011 , −7.3 % in 2012 and −3.2 % in 2013 . In 2011 , the country 's public debt reached €356 billion ( 172 % of nominal GDP ) . After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector , Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion ( 137 % of GDP ) in the first quarter of 2012 . Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7 % in 2014 after 6 years of economic decline , but fell back into recession in 2015 .
The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising Hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the Muslim Umayyad army led by Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712 , by defeating Raja Dahir . The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad .

The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region .
One way of proving that a given disease is " infectious " , is to satisfy Koch 's postulates ( first proposed by Robert Koch ) , which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls , and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease . These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis . Koch 's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture . Often , even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria . For example , Treponema pallidum , the causative spirochete of syphilis , can not be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes . It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture . Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population . For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic ( occasional occurrence ) , endemic ( regular cases often occurring in a region ) , epidemic ( an unusually high number of cases in a region ) , or pandemic ( a global epidemic ) .
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French Invader . He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " Rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik 's Cubes . Although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well .
Yet another may have been a reduction in the real-estate listings and property-related financial services ( such as mortgage loans or insurance policies ) offered in some areas of the Bronx — a process known as redlining . Others have suggested a " planned shrinkage " of municipal services , such as fire-fighting . There was also much debate as to whether rent control laws had made it less profitable ( or more costly ) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings .
The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome 's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays . In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater ( Great Mother ) from Pessinus , installed on the Palatine in 191 BC . The mystery cult to Bacchus followed ; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC . Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium : temples were dedicated to Juventas ( Hebe ) in 191 BC , Diana ( Artemis ) in 179 BC , Mars ( Ares ) in 138 BC ) , and to Bona Dea , equivalent to Fauna , the female counterpart of the rural Faunus , supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia . Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman Penates as forms of the Greek Dioscuri . The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma ( identified with Roman Bellona , the Egyptian mystery-goddess Isis and Persian Mithras . )
The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends .

He has brought some Gops with him and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal .
The great Navicella mosaic ( 1305–1313 ) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter 's is attributed to Giotto di Bondone . The giant mosaic , commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi , was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard . It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters . This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter 's in the 17th century . Navicella means " little ship " referring to the large boat which dominated the scene , and whose sail , filled by the storm , loomed over the horizon . Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art .
The required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a Supreme Being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( Tennessee Constitution Article IX , Section 2 is one such example . ) Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me God . " In some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . At one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
Promote and Publicize the Party 's Agenda . An important aim of the minority leader is to develop an electorally attractive agenda of ideas and proposals that unites his or her own House members and that energizes and appeals to core electoral supporters as well as independents and swing voters . Despite the minority leader 's restricted ability to set the House 's agenda , there are still opportunities for him to raise minority priorities . For example , the minority leader may employ , or threaten to use , discharge petitions to try and bring minority priorities to the floor . If he or she is able to attract the required 218 signatures on a discharge petition by attracting majority party supporters , he or she can force minority initiatives to the floor over the opposition of the majority leadership . As a GOP minority leader once said , the challenges he confronted are to " keep our people together , and to look for votes on the other side . "
Regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the Bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . India 's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . However , the Chief Wildlife Warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . In this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
